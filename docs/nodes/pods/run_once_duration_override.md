The Run Once Duration Override Operator enforces time limits on run-once pods to prevent tasks from running indefinitely and consuming cluster resources.

## About the Run Once Duration Override Operator {#rodoo-about_run-once-duration-override-about}

The Run Once Duration Override Operator enforces time limits on run-once pods to prevent tasks such as builds and deployments from running indefinitely.

OpenShift Container Platform relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as deploying a pod or performing a build. Run-once pods are pods that have a `RestartPolicy` of `Never` or `OnFailure`.

Cluster administrators can use the Run Once Duration Override Operator to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active. After the time limit expires, the cluster tries to actively terminate those pods.

To apply the run-once duration override from the Run Once Duration Override Operator to run-once pods, you must enable it on each applicable namespace.

If both the run-once pod and the Run Once Duration Override Operator have their `activeDeadlineSeconds` value set, the lower of the two values is used.

:::note

You cannot install the Run Once Duration Override Operator on clusters managed by the HyperShift Operator.
