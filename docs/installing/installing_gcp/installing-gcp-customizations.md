# Installing a cluster on Google Cloud with customizations {#installing-gcp-customizations}

<a id="installing-gcp-customizations"></a>

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.22, you can install a cluster on Google Cloud by using installer-provisioned infrastructure with customizations, including network configuration options. In each, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation, and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running cluster.

## Prerequisites {#_prerequisites}

- You reviewed details about the [OpenShift Container Platform installation and update](/docs/architecture/architecture-installation#architecture-installation) processes.
- You read the documentation on [selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users](/docs/installing/overview/installing-preparing#installing-preparing).
- You [configured a Google Cloud project](/docs/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account#installing-gcp-account) to host the cluster.
- If you use a firewall, you [configured it to allow the sites](/docs/installing/install_config/configuring-firewall#configuring-firewall-module_configuring-firewall) that your cluster requires access to.

## Internet access for OpenShift Container Platform {#cluster-entitlements_installing-gcp-customizations}

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.22, you require access to the internet to install your cluster.

You must have internet access to perform the following actions:

- Access Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
- Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
- Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

:::warning

If your cluster cannot have direct internet access, you can perform a restricted network installation on some types of infrastructure that you provision. During that process, you download the required content and use it to populate a mirror registry with the installation packages. With some installation types, the environment that you install your cluster in will not require internet access. Before you update the cluster, you update the content of the mirror registry.

:::

## Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access {#ssh-agent-using_installing-gcp-customizations}

During an OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

The key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node, which enables password-less authentication. After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user `core`. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The `./openshift-install gather` command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

:::warning

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.

:::

:::note

You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches.

:::

**Procedure**

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>
   ```

   Specifies the path and file name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your `~/.ssh` directory.

   :::note

   If you plan to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures, do not create a key that uses the `ed25519` algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the `rsa` or `ecdsa` algorithm.

   :::
2. View the public SSH key:
   ```terminal
   $ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
   ```

   For example, run the following to view the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` public key:

   ```terminal
   $ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the `./openshift-install gather` command.
   :::note

   On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are managed automatically.

   :::

   1. If the `ssh-agent` process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:
      ```terminal
      $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      Agent pid 31874
      ```

      :::note

      If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.

      :::
4. Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:
   ```terminal
   $ ssh-add <path>/<file_name>
   ```

   Specifies the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
   ```

**Next steps**

- When you install OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

## Obtaining the installation program {#installation-obtaining-installer_installing-gcp-customizations}

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on

the host you are using for installation.

**Prerequisites**

- You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.

**Procedure**

1. Go to the [Cluster Type](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install) page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
   :::tip

   You can also [download the binaries for a specific OpenShift Container Platform release](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/).

   :::
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the **Run it yourself** section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under **OpenShift Installer** and click **Download Installer**.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.
   :::warning

   - The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
   - Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.

   :::
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
   ```
6. Download your installation [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret). This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for OpenShift Container Platform components.
   :::tip

   Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/), where you can specify a version of the installation program to download. However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.

   :::

## Creating the installation configuration file {#installation-initializing_installing-gcp-customizations}

You can customize the OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on Google Cloud.

**Prerequisites**

- You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
- Configure a Google Cloud account.

**Procedure**

1. Create the `install-config.yaml` file.
   1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory>
      ```

      - `<installation_directory>`: For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the files that the installation program creates.
        When specifying the directory:
      - Verify that the directory has the `execute` permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
      - Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.
   2. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
      1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
         :::note

         For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

         :::
      2. Select **gcp** as the platform to target.
      3. If you have not configured the service account key for your Google Cloud account on your computer, you must obtain it from Google Cloud and paste the contents of the file or enter the absolute path to the file.
      4. Select the project ID to provision the cluster in. The default value is specified by the service account that you configured.
      5. Select the region to deploy the cluster to.
      6. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds to the public DNS zone that you created for your cluster.
      7. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
2. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.
   :::note

   If you are installing a three-node cluster, be sure to set the `compute.replicas` parameter to `0`. This ensures that the cluster’s control planes are schedulable. For more information, see "Installing a three-node cluster on Google Cloud".

   :::
3. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install multiple clusters.
   :::warning

   The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.

### Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation {#installation-minimum-resource-requirements_installing-gcp-customizations}

To ensure that your OpenShift Container Platform cluster runs as expected, each cluster machine must meet minimum CPU, memory, and storage requirements.

- One vCPU is equal to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
- OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and Red Hat recommends faster storage, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. On many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to provision more storage to get enough performance.
- As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later do not support RHEL 7 compute machines.

:::note

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.22, RHCOS uses RHEL version 9.8, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. Each architecture requires the following minimum instruction set architectures (ISA):

- x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
- ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
- ppc64le architecture requires IBM(R) Power9 ISA
- s390x architecture requires IBM(R) z14 ISA

For more information, see [Architectures](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/9.8_release_notes/index#architectures) in the RHEL documentation.

:::

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in OpenShift Container Platform.

### Tested instance types for Google Cloud {#installation-gcp-tested-machine-types_installing-gcp-customizations}

The following Google Cloud instance types have been tested with OpenShift Container Platform.

:::note

Not all instance types are available in all regions and zones. For a detailed breakdown of which instance types are available in which zones, see [regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available) (Google documentation).

Some instance types require the use of Hyperdisk storage. If you use an instance type that requires Hyperdisk storage, all of the nodes in your cluster must support Hyperdisk storage, and you must change the default storage class to use Hyperdisk storage. For more information, see [machine series support for Hyperdisk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/hyperdisks#machine-type-support) (Google documentation). For instructions on modifying storage classes, see the "GCE PersistentDisk (gcePD) object definition" section in the Dynamic Provisioning page in *Storage*.

### Tested instance types for Google Cloud on 64-bit ARM infrastructures {#installation-gcp-tested-machine-types-arm_installing-gcp-customizations}

The following Google Cloud 64-bit ARM instance types have been tested with OpenShift Container Platform.

See the following machine series for 64-bit ARM machines:

- `C4A`
- `N4A`
- `Tau T2A`

### Using custom machine types {#installation-custom-machine-types_installing-gcp-customizations}

Using a custom machine type to install a OpenShift Container Platform cluster is supported.

Consider the following when using a custom machine type:

- Similar to predefined instance types, custom machine types must meet the minimum resource requirements for control plane and compute machines. For more information, see "Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation".
- The name of the custom machine type must adhere to the following syntax: `custom-<number_of_cpus>-<amount_of_memory_in_mb>`
  For example, `custom-6-20480`.

As part of the installation process, you specify the custom machine type in the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml title="Sample install-config.yaml file with a custom machine type"
compute:
- architecture: amd64
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform:
    gcp:
      type: custom-6-20480
  replicas: 2
controlPlane:
  architecture: amd64
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  platform:
    gcp:
      type: custom-6-20480
  replicas: 3
```

### Enabling Shielded VMs {#installation-gcp-enabling-shielded-vms_installing-gcp-customizations}

You can use Shielded VMs when installing your cluster. Shielded VMs have extra security features including secure boot, firmware and integrity monitoring, and rootkit detection. For more information, see Google’s documentation on [Shielded VMs](https://cloud.google.com/shielded-vm).

:::note

Shielded VMs are currently not supported on clusters with 64-bit ARM infrastructures.

:::

**Procedure**

- Use a text editor to edit the `install-config.yaml` file prior to deploying your cluster and add one of the following stanzas:
  1. To use shielded VMs for only control plane machines:
     ```yaml
     controlPlane:
       platform:
         gcp:
            secureBoot: Enabled
     ```
  2. To use shielded VMs for only compute machines:
     ```yaml
     compute:
     - platform:
         gcp:
            secureBoot: Enabled
     ```
  3. To use shielded VMs for all machines:
     ```yaml
     platform:
       gcp:
         defaultMachinePlatform:
            secureBoot: Enabled
     ```

### Enabling Confidential VMs {#installation-gcp-enabling-confidential-vms_installing-gcp-customizations}

You can use Confidential VMs when installing your cluster. Confidential VMs encrypt data while it is being processed. For more information, see Google’s documentation on [Confidential Computing](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing). You can enable Confidential VMs and Shielded VMs at the same time, although they are not dependent on each other.

:::note

Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures.

:::

**Procedure**

- Use a text editor to edit the `install-config.yaml` file prior to deploying your cluster and add one of the following stanzas:
  1. To use confidential VMs for only control plane machines:
     ```yaml
     controlPlane:
       platform:
         gcp:
            confidentialCompute: AMDEncryptedVirtualizationNestedPaging (1)
            type: n2d-standard-8 (2)
            onHostMaintenance: Terminate (3)
     ```

     1. Enable confidential VMs with AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization Secure Nested Paging (AMD SEV-SNP). For more information about available options, see "Additional Google Cloud configuration parameters".
     2. Specify a machine type that supports Confidential VMs. Confidential VMs require the N2D, C2D, C3D, or C3 series of machine types. For more information on supported machine types, see [Supported operating systems and machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/confidential-vm/docs/os-and-machine-type#machine-type).
     3. Specify the behavior of the VM during a host maintenance event, such as a hardware or software update. For a machine that uses Confidential VM, this value must be set to `Terminate`, which stops the VM. Confidential VMs do not support live VM migration.
  2. To use confidential VMs for only compute machines:
     ```yaml
     compute:
     - platform:
         gcp:
            confidentialCompute: AMDEncryptedVirtualizationNestedPaging
            type: n2d-standard-8
            onHostMaintenance: Terminate
     ```
  3. To use confidential VMs for all machines:
     ```yaml
     platform:
       gcp:
         defaultMachinePlatform:
            confidentialCompute: AMDEncryptedVirtualizationNestedPaging
            type: n2d-standard-8
            onHostMaintenance: Terminate
     ```

### Enabling a user-managed DNS {#installation-gcp-enabling-user-managed-DNS_installing-gcp-customizations}

You can install a cluster with a domain name server (DNS) solution that you manage instead of the default cluster-provisioned DNS solution. As a result, you can manage the API and Ingress DNS records in your own system rather than adding the records to the DNS of the cloud.

For example, your organization’s security policies might not allow the use of public DNS services such as Google Cloud DNS. In such scenarios, you can use your own DNS service to bypass the public DNS service and manage your own DNS for the IP addresses of the API and Ingress services.

If you enable user-managed DNS during installation, the installation program provisions DNS records for the API and Ingress services only within the cluster. To ensure access from outside the cluster, you must provision the DNS records in an external DNS service of your choice for the API and Ingress services after installation.

**Prerequisites**

- You installed the `jq` package.

**Procedure**

- Before you deploy your cluster, use a text editor to open the `install-config.yaml` file  and add the following stanza:
  - To enable user-managed DNS:
    ```yaml
    platform:
      gcp:
        userProvisionedDNS: Enabled
    ```

    where:

    <dl>
    <dt><code>Enabled</code></dt>
    <dd>Enables user-provisioned DNS management.</dd>
    </dl>

For information about provisioning your DNS records for the API server and the Ingress services, see "Provisioning your own DNS records".

### Sample customized install-config.yaml file for Google Cloud {#installation-gcp-config-yaml_installing-gcp-customizations}

To specify more details about your OpenShift Container Platform cluster’s platform or modify the values of the required parameters, you can customize the `install-config.yaml` file.

:::warning

This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your `install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program and modify it.

:::

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
controlPlane:
  name: master
  replicas: 3
  platform:
    gcp:
      type: n2-standard-4
compute:
- name: worker
  replicas: 3
  platform:
    gcp:
      type: n2-standard-4

    region: us-east1
```

where:

`controlPlane`
: Specifies parameters that apply to control plane machines.

`compute`
: Specifies parameters that apply to compute machines.

`networking`
: Specifies parameters that apply to the cluster networking configuration. If you do not provide networking values, the installation program provides default values.

`platform`
: Specifies parameters that apply to the infrastructure platform that hosts the cluster.

### Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation {#installation-configure-proxy_installing-gcp-customizations}

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file.

**Prerequisites**

- You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.
- You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, the proxy handles all cluster egress traffic, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object’s `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary.
  :::note

  The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field includes the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration.

  For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field also includes the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).

  :::

**Procedure**

1. Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   baseDomain: my.domain.com
   proxy:
     httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
     httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
     noProxy: example.com
   additionalTrustBundle: |
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
       -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
   # ...
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>proxy.httpProxy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be <code>http</code>.</dd>
   <dt><code>proxy.httpsProxy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.</dd>
   <dt><code>proxy.noProxy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with <code>.</code> to match subdomains only. For example, <code>.y.com</code> matches <code>x.y.com</code>, but not <code>y.com</code>. Use <code>*</code> to bypass the proxy for all destinations.</dd>
   <dt><code>additionalTrustBundle</code></dt>
   <dd>If you specify this value, the installation program generates a config map named <code>user-ca-bundle</code> in the <code>openshift-config</code> namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you specify <code>additionalTrustBundle</code> and at least one proxy setting, the <code>Proxy</code> object references the <code>user-ca-bundle</code> config map in the <code>trustedCA</code> field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a <code>trusted-ca-bundle</code> config map that merges the contents specified for the <code>trustedCA</code> parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. You must set the <code>additionalTrustBundle</code> field unless an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle signs the proxy’s identity certificate.</dd>
   <dt><code>additionalTrustBundlePolicy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the <code>Proxy</code> object to reference the <code>user-ca-bundle</code> config map in the <code>trustedCA</code> field. The allowed values are <code>Proxyonly</code> and <code>Always</code>. Use <code>Proxyonly</code> to reference the <code>user-ca-bundle</code> config map only when you configure an <code>http/https</code> proxy. Use <code>Always</code> to always reference the <code>user-ca-bundle</code> config map. The default value is <code>Proxyonly</code>. Optional parameter.</dd>
   </dl>

   :::note

   The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field.

   :::

   :::note

   If the installation program times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installation program. For example:

   ```terminal
   $ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
   ```

   :::
2. Save the file and reference it when installing OpenShift Container Platform.
   The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy named `cluster` that uses the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. If you do not give proxy settings, the installation program still creates a `cluster` `Proxy` object, but it has a nil `spec`.

   :::note

   Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and you cannot create additional proxies.

## Managing user-defined labels and tags for Google Cloud {#installing-gcp-user-defined-labels-and-tags_installing-gcp-customizations}

Google Cloud provides labels and tags that help to identify and organize the resources created for a specific OpenShift Container Platform cluster, making them easier to manage.

You can define labels and tags for each Google Cloud resource only during OpenShift Container Platform cluster installation.

:::warning

User-defined labels and tags are not supported for OpenShift Container Platform clusters upgraded to OpenShift Container Platform 4.22.

:::

:::note

You cannot update the tags that are already added. Also, a new tag-supported resource creation fails if the configured tag keys or tag values are deleted.

:::

**User-defined labels**

User-defined labels and OpenShift Container Platform specific labels are applied only to resources created by OpenShift Container Platform installation program and its core components such as:

- Google Cloud filestore CSI Driver Operator
- Google Cloud PD CSI Driver Operator
- Image Registry Operator
- Machine API provider for Google Cloud

User-defined labels are not attached to the resources created by any other Operators or the Kubernetes in-tree components.

User-defined labels and OpenShift Container Platform labels are available on the following Google Cloud resources:

- Compute disk
- Compute forwarding rule
- Compute image
- Compute instance
- DNS managed zone
- Filestore backup
- Filestore instance
- Storage bucket

**Limitations to user-defined labels**

- Labels for `ComputeAddress` are supported in the Google Cloud beta version. OpenShift Container Platform does not add labels to the resource.

**User-defined tags**

User-defined tags are applied only to resources created by OpenShift Container Platform installation program and its core components, such as the following resources:

- Google Cloud FileStore CSI Driver Operator
- Google Cloud PD CSI Driver Operator
- Image Registry Operator
- Machine API provider for Google Cloud

User-defined tags are not attached to the resources created by any other Operators or the Kubernetes in-tree components.

User-defined tags are available on the following Google Cloud resources:

- Compute disk
- Compute instance
- Filestore backup
- Filestore instance
- Storage bucket

**Limitations to the user-defined tags**

- Tags must not be restricted to particular service accounts, because Operators create and use service accounts with minimal roles.
- OpenShift Container Platform does not create any key and value resources of the tag.
- OpenShift Container Platform specific tags are not added to any resource.

### Criteria for user-defined labels and tags {#installing-gcp-cluster-label-tag-reference_installing-gcp-customizations}

Before configuring user-defined labels and tags for Google Cloud, consider the importance of meeting the requirements for these tag and labels to ensure proper resource governance.

The following list details the requirements for user-defined labels:

- A label key and value must have a minimum of 1 character and can have a maximum of 63 characters.
- A label key and value must contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, an underscore (`_`), and a dash (`-`).
- A label key must start with a lowercase letter.
- You can configure a maximum of 32 labels per resource.
  - Each resource has a maximum of 64 labels, where OpenShift Container Platform reserves 32 labels for internal use.

The following list details the requirements for user-defined tags:

- Tag key and tag value must already exist. OpenShift Container Platform does not create the key and the value.
- A tag `parentID` can be either `OrganizationID` or `ProjectID`:
  - `OrganizationID` must consist of decimal numbers without leading zeros.
  - `ProjectID` must be 6 to 30 characters in length, that includes only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
  - `ProjectID` must start with a letter, and cannot end with a hyphen.
- A tag key must contain only uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters, a hyphen (`-`), an underscore (`_`), and a period (`.`).
- A tag value must contain only uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters and any of the following characters:
  - A colon (`:`)
  - A comma (`,`)
  - A curly braces (`{}`)
  - A hyphen (`-`)
  - A parentheses (`()`)
  - A percent sign (`%`)
  - A plus (`+`)
  - A pound sign (`$`)
  - A space.
  - A square braces (`[]`)
  - An ampersand (`&`)
  - An asterisk (`*`)
  - An at sign (`@`)
  - An equals sign (`=`)
  - An underscore (`_`)
  - A period (`.`)
- A tag key and value must begin and end with an alphanumeric character.
- Tag value must be one of the predefined values for the key.
- You can configure a maximum of 50 tags.
- Do not define a tag key with the same value as any of the existing tag keys that get inherited from the parent resource.

### Configuring user-defined labels and tags for Google Cloud {#installing-gcp-cluster-creation_installing-gcp-customizations}

Configuring user-defined labels and tags for Google Cloud means that you can apply key-value pairs to your cloud resources for the purposes of organizing, managing, and automating your infrastructure.

**Prerequisites**

- The installation program requires that a service account includes a `TagUser` role, so that the program can create the OpenShift Container Platform cluster with defined tags at both organization and project levels.

**Procedure**

- Update the `install-config.yaml` file to define the list of required labels and tags.
  :::note

  If you set labels and tags during creation of the `install-config.yaml` configuration file, you cannot create new or update existing labels and tags after creation of the cluster.

  :::

  ```yaml title="Sample install-config.yaml file"
  apiVersion: v1
  credentialsMode: Passthrough (1)
  platform:
   gcp:
     userLabels: (2)
     - key: <label_key><3>
       value: <label_value><4>
     userTags: (5)
     - parentID: <OrganizationID/ProjectID><6>
       key: <tag_key_short_name>
       value: <tag_value_short_name>
  # ...
  ```

  1. In passthrough mode, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) passes the provided cloud credential to the components that request cloud credentials.
  2. Adds keys and values as labels to the resources created on Google Cloud.
  3. Defines the label name.
  4. Defines the label content.
  5. Adds keys and values as tags to the resources created on Google Cloud.
  6. The ID of the hierarchical resource where you defined the tags at the organization or the project level.

### Querying user-defined labels and tags for Google Cloud {#installing-gcp-querying-labels-tags-gcp_installing-gcp-customizations}

After creating the OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can access the list of the labels and tags defined for the Google Cloud resources  in the `infrastructures.config.openshift.io/cluster` object as shown in the following sample `infrastructure.yaml` file.

```yaml title="Sample infrastructure.yaml file"
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Infrastructure
metadata:
 name: cluster
spec:
 platformSpec:
   type: GCP
status:
 infrastructureName: <cluster_id><1>
 platform: GCP
 platformStatus:
   gcp:
     resourceLabels:
     - key: <label_key>
       value: <label_value>
     resourceTags:
     - key: <tag_key_short_name>
       parentID: <OrganizationID/ProjectID>
       value: <tag_value_short_name>
   type: GCP
```

1. The cluster ID that is generated during cluster installation.

Along with the user-defined labels, resources have a label defined by the OpenShift Container Platform. The format of the OpenShift Container Platform labels is `kubernetes-io-cluster-<cluster_id>:owned`.

## Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project {#installing-gcp-manual-modes_installing-gcp-customizations}

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives:

- To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in [Manually creating long-term credentials](/docs/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations#manually-create-iam_installing-gcp-customizations).
- To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in [Configuring a Google Cloud cluster to use short-term credentials](/docs/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations#installing-gcp-with-short-term-creds_installing-gcp-customizations).

### Manually creating long-term credentials {#manually-create-iam_installing-gcp-customizations}

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) can be put into manual mode prior to installation in environments where the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not reachable, or the administrator prefers not to store an administrator-level credential secret in the cluster `kube-system` namespace.

**Procedure**

1. Add the following granular permissions to the Google Cloud account that the installation program uses:
   - compute.machineTypes.list
   - compute.regions.list
   - compute.zones.list
   - dns.changes.create
   - dns.changes.get
   - dns.managedZones.create
   - dns.managedZones.delete
   - dns.managedZones.get
   - dns.managedZones.list
   - dns.networks.bindPrivateDNSZone
   - dns.resourceRecordSets.create
   - dns.resourceRecordSets.delete
   - dns.resourceRecordSets.list
2. If you did not set the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file to `Manual`, modify the value as shown:
   ```yaml title="Sample configuration file snippet"
   apiVersion: v1
   baseDomain: example.com
   credentialsMode: Manual
   # ...
   ```
3. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
   ```

   where `<installation_directory>` is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
4. Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
   ```
5. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc adm release extract \
     --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
     --credentials-requests \
     --included \
     --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \
     --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>--included</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.</dd>
   <dt><code>&lt;path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the location of the <code>install-config.yaml</code> file.</dd>
   <dt><code>&lt;path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the path to the directory where you want to store the <code>CredentialsRequest</code> objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it. This command creates a YAML file for each <code>CredentialsRequest</code> object.</dd>
   </dl>

   ```yaml title="Sample CredentialsRequest object"
   apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
   kind: CredentialsRequest
   metadata:
     name: <component_credentials_request>
     namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
     ...
   spec:
     providerSpec:
       apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
       kind: GCPProviderSpec
       predefinedRoles:
       - roles/storage.admin
       - roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
       skipServiceCheck: true
     ...
   ```
6. Create YAML files for secrets in the `openshift-install` manifests directory that you generated previously. The secrets must be stored using the namespace and secret name defined in the `spec.secretRef` for each `CredentialsRequest` object.
   ```yaml title="Sample CredentialsRequest object with secrets"
   apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
   kind: CredentialsRequest
   metadata:
     name: <component_credentials_request>
     namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
     ...
   spec:
     providerSpec:
       apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
         ...
     secretRef:
       name: <component_secret>
       namespace: <component_namespace>
     ...
   ```

   ```yaml title="Sample Secret object"
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: <component_secret>
     namespace: <component_namespace>
   data:
     service_account.json: <base64_encoded_gcp_service_account_file>
   ```

   :::warning

   Before upgrading a cluster that uses manually maintained credentials, you must ensure that the CCO is in an upgradeable state.

### Configuring a Google Cloud cluster to use short-term credentials {#installing-gcp-with-short-term-creds_installing-gcp-customizations}

To install a cluster that is configured to use Google Cloud Workload Identity, you must configure the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility and create the required Google Cloud resources for your cluster. Cluster Operators use the credentials created by the CCO. The installation program does not use these credentials.

#### Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility {#cco-ccoctl-configuring_installing-gcp-customizations}

To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) binary.

:::note

The `ccoctl` utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access.
- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have added one of the following authentication options to the Google Cloud account that the `ccoctl` utility uses:
  - The **IAM Workload Identity Pool Admin** role
  - The following granular permissions:
    - `compute.projects.get`
    - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.create`
    - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.get`
    - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.create`
    - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.delete`
    - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.get`
    - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.undelete`
    - `iam.roles.create`
    - `iam.roles.delete`
    - `iam.roles.list`
    - `iam.roles.undelete`
    - `iam.roles.update`
    - `iam.serviceAccounts.create`
    - `iam.serviceAccounts.delete`
    - `iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy`
    - `iam.serviceAccounts.list`
    - `iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy`
    - `iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders.get`
    - `iam.workloadIdentityPools.delete`
    - `resourcemanager.projects.get`
    - `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy`
    - `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy`
    - `storage.buckets.create`
    - `storage.buckets.delete`
    - `storage.buckets.get`
    - `storage.buckets.getIamPolicy`
    - `storage.buckets.setIamPolicy`
    - `storage.objects.create`
    - `storage.objects.delete`
    - `storage.objects.list`

**Procedure**

1. Set a variable for the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
   ```
2. Obtain the CCO container image from the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE -a ~/.pull-secret)
   ```

   :::note

   Ensure that the architecture of the `$RELEASE_IMAGE` matches the architecture of the environment in which you will use the `ccoctl` tool.

   :::
3. Extract the `ccoctl` binary from the CCO container image within the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE \
     --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl.<rhel_version>" \
     -a ~/.pull-secret
   ```

   For `<rhel_version>`, specify the value that corresponds to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that the host uses. If no value is specified, `ccoctl.rhel8` is used by default. The following values are valid:

   - `rhel8`: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 8.
   - `rhel9`: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 9.
     :::note

     The `ccoctl` binary is created in the directory from where you executed the command and not in `/usr/bin/`. You must rename the directory or move the `ccoctl.<rhel_version>` binary to `ccoctl`.

     :::
4. Change the permissions to make `ccoctl` executable by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ chmod 775 ccoctl
   ```

**Verification**

- To verify that `ccoctl` is ready to use, display the help file. Use a relative file name when you run the command, for example:
  ```terminal
  $ ./ccoctl
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  OpenShift credentials provisioning tool

  Usage:
    ccoctl [command]

  Available Commands:
    aws          Manage credentials objects for AWS cloud
    azure        Manage credentials objects for Azure
    gcp          Manage credentials objects for Google cloud
    help         Help about any command
    ibmcloud     Manage credentials objects for IBM Cloud
    nutanix      Manage credentials objects for Nutanix

  Flags:
    -h, --help   help for ccoctl

  Use "ccoctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
  ```

#### Creating Google Cloud resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility {#_creating_gcp_short_resources_with_the_cloud_credential_operator_utility}

You can use the `ccoctl gcp create-all` command to automate the creation of Google Cloud resources.

:::note

By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` to refer to this directory.

:::

**Prerequisites**

You must have:

- Extracted and prepared the `ccoctl` binary.

**Procedure**

1. Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
   ```
2. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` objects from the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc adm release extract \
     --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
     --credentials-requests \
     --included \
     --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \
     --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>--included</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies to include only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.</dd>
   <dt><code>&lt;path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the location of the <code>install-config.yaml</code> file.</dd>
   <dt><code>&lt;path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the path to the directory where you want to store the <code>CredentialsRequest</code> objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.</dd>
   </dl>

   :::note

   This command might take a few moments to run.

   :::
3. Use the `ccoctl` tool to process all `CredentialsRequest` objects by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ ccoctl gcp create-all \
     --name=<name> \
     --region=<gcp_region> \
     --project=<gcp_project_id> \
     --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \
     --key-storage-method=<key_storage_method>
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;name&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the user-defined name for all created Google Cloud resources used for tracking. If you plan to install the Google Cloud Filestore Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator, retain this value.</dd>
   <dt><code>&lt;gcp_region&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the Google Cloud region in which cloud resources will be created.</dd>
   <dt><code>&lt;gcp_project_id&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the Google Cloud project ID in which cloud resources will be created.</dd>
   <dt><code>&lt;path_to_credentials_requests_directory&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the directory containing the files of <code>CredentialsRequest</code> manifests to create Google Cloud service accounts.</dd>
   <dt><code>&lt;key_storage_method&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the method for storing OIDC JWK files. Accepted values are <code>public-bucket</code> and <code>pool-jwk-file</code>. The default value <code>public-bucket</code> creates a public GCS bucket to host the OIDC configuration and JWK files. The <code>pool-jwk-file</code> value attaches the JWK directly to the workload identity pool provider without creating a public bucket. This parameter is optional.</dd>
   </dl>

   :::note

   If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, you must include the `--enable-tech-preview` parameter.

   :::

**Verification**

- To verify that the OpenShift Container Platform secrets are created, list the files in the `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests` directory:
  ```terminal
  $ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests
  ```

  ```text title="Example output"
  cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml
  openshift-cloud-controller-manager-gcp-ccm-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml

  ```

  You can verify that the IAM service accounts are created by querying Google Cloud. For more information, refer to Google Cloud documentation on listing IAM service accounts.

#### Restricting service account impersonation to the compute nodes service account {#restricting-sa-impersonation-compute-sa-gcp_installing-gcp-customizations}

After the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) creates the resources for the cluster, you can restrict the Google Cloud `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission that the `ccoctl` utility granted to the Machine API controller service account to the compute nodes service account.

:::note

Restricting service account impersonation to the compute nodes service account is optional. If your organization does not require this change, you can continue to "Incorporating the Cloud Credential Operator utility manifests".

:::

When the `ccoctl` utility assigns custom and Google Cloud predefined roles to OpenShift Container Platform components service accounts, it grants the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission to the Machine API controller service account at the Google Cloud project level. To reduce the scope of the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission, you identify the custom role of the Machine API controller service account and replace it with a role that has a more restricted set of permissions. To allow this component to work, you then grant the Machine API controller service account the Service Account User role on the service account of the compute nodes instead.

**Prerequisites**

- You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
- You have used the `ccoctl` utility to create the cloud provider resources for your cluster.
- You have access to your `install-config.yaml` file.
- You have logged in to the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) as a user with permissions to manage service accounts and roles.

**Procedure**

1. Obtain the following values from your `install-config.yaml` file:
   - The Google Cloud project name. In the YAML file, this is the value of the `platform.gcp.projectID` parameter.
   - The cluster name. In the YAML file, this is the value of the `metadata.name` parameter.
   - The service account for the compute nodes. In the YAML file, this is the value of the `compute[0].platform.gcp.serviceAccount` parameter.
2. Obtain the service account for the Machine API controller that the `ccoctl` utility created by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud iam service-accounts list \
     --filter="displayName=<cluster_name>-openshift-machine-api-gcp" \
     --format='value(email)'
   ```

   where `<cluster_name>` is the value specified for the `metadata.name` parameter in your `install-config.yaml` file.
3. Obtain the role ID of the custom role for the Machine API controller service account by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud projects get-iam-policy <project_name> \
     --flatten='bindings[].members' \
     --format='table(bindings.role)' \
     --filter="bindings.members:<machine_api_controller_service_account>"
   ```

   where `<machine_api_controller_service_account>` is the Machine API controller service account.
4. List the custom role permissions for the Machine API controller service account by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud iam roles describe <machine_api_role> \
     --project <project_name>
   ```

   where `<machine_api_role>` is the role ID of the custom role for the Machine API controller service account.

   ```text title="Example output"
   etag: <etag_value>
   includedPermissions:
   - compute.acceleratorTypes.get
   - compute.acceleratorTypes.list
   - compute.disks.create
   - compute.disks.createTagBinding
   ...
   - compute.zones.get
   - compute.zones.list
   - iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
   - iam.serviceAccounts.get
   - iam.serviceAccounts.list
   - resourcemanager.tagValues.get
   - resourcemanager.tagValues.list
   - serviceusage.quotas.get
   - serviceusage.services.get
   - serviceusage.services.list
   name: projects/<project_name>/roles/<machine_api_role>
   stage: GA
   title: <project_name>-openshift-machine-api-gcp
   ```

   where `<project_name>` is the Google Cloud project name specified in the `install-config.yaml` file.

   :::note

   This truncated example output might not match the permissions list for your cluster.

   :::
5. Create a custom role that includes all of the permissions from your output except for the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission by running a command similar to the following:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud iam roles create <machine_api_role>_without_actas \
   --project=<project_name> \
   --title=<machine_api_role>_without_actas \
   --description="Required permissions for the Machine API controller without the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission" \
   --permissions=compute.acceleratorTypes.get,\
   compute.acceleratorTypes.list,\
   compute.disks.create,\
   compute.disks.createTagBinding,\
   ...
   compute.zones.get,\
   compute.zones.list,\
   iam.serviceAccounts.get,\
   iam.serviceAccounts.list,\
   resourcemanager.tagValues.get,\
   resourcemanager.tagValues.list,\
   serviceusage.quotas.get,\
   serviceusage.services.get,\
   serviceusage.services.list
   ```

   In this example, the new role name is the original custom role name, `<machine_api_role>`, with a `_without_actas` string added to the end.

   :::warning

   This truncated example command might not match the permissions list for your cluster. You must use the list of permissions from the output of the `gcloud iam roles describe <machine_api_role> --project <project_name>` command on your cluster.

   :::
6. Remove the custom role that includes the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission from the Machine API controller service account by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding <project_name> \
     --member "serviceAccount:<machine_api_controller_service_account>" \
     --role "projects/<project_name>/roles/<machine_api_role>"
   ```

   where `<machine_api_role>` is the original custom role.
7. Grant the custom role that excludes the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission to the Machine API controller service account by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project_name> \
     --member "serviceAccount:<machine_api_controller_service_account>" \
     --role "projects/<project_name>/roles/<machine_api_role>_without_actas
   ```

   where `<machine_api_role>_without_actas` is the new custom role.
8. Optional: To verify that the Machine API controller service account has the correct role, check the attached role ID by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud projects get-iam-policy <project_name> \
     --flatten='bindings[].members' \
     --format='table(bindings.role)' \
     --filter="bindings.members:<machine_api_controller_service_account>"
   ```

   ```text title="Example output"
   ROLE
   projects/<project_name>/roles/<machine_api_role>_without_actas
   ```
9. Grant the Machine API controller service account the Service Account User role on the service account of the compute nodes by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding <compute_nodes_service_account> \
     --member="serviceAccount:<machine_api_controller_service_account>" \
     --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
   ```

   where `<compute_nodes_service_account>` is the service account for your compute nodes. This value is the `compute[0].platform.gcp.serviceAccount` parameter in your `install-config.yaml` file.

#### Incorporating the Cloud Credential Operator utility manifests {#cco-ccoctl-install-creating-manifests_installing-gcp-customizations}

To implement short-term security credentials managed outside the cluster for individual components, you must move the manifest files that the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) created to the correct directories for the installation program.

**Prerequisites**

- You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
- You have configured the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`).
- You have created the cloud provider resources that are required for your cluster with the `ccoctl` utility.

**Procedure**

1. Add the following granular permissions to the Google Cloud account that the installation program uses:
   - compute.machineTypes.list
   - compute.regions.list
   - compute.zones.list
   - dns.changes.create
   - dns.changes.get
   - dns.managedZones.create
   - dns.managedZones.delete
   - dns.managedZones.get
   - dns.managedZones.list
   - dns.networks.bindPrivateDNSZone
   - dns.resourceRecordSets.create
   - dns.resourceRecordSets.delete
   - dns.resourceRecordSets.list
2. If you did not set the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file to `Manual`, modify the value as shown:
   ```yaml title="Sample configuration file snippet"
   apiVersion: v1
   baseDomain: example.com
   credentialsMode: Manual
   # ...
   ```
3. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
   ```

   where `<installation_directory>` is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
4. Copy the manifests that the `ccoctl` utility generated to the `manifests` directory that the installation program created by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ cp /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/* ./manifests/
   ```
5. Copy the `tls` directory that contains the private key to the installation directory:
   ```terminal
   $ cp -a /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/tls .
   ```

## Using the Google Cloud Marketplace offering {#installation-gcp-marketplace_installing-gcp-customizations}

Using the Google Cloud Marketplace offering lets you deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, which is billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through Google Cloud, while still being supported directly by Red Hat.

By default, the installation program downloads and installs the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image that is used to deploy compute machines. To deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an RHCOS image from the Google Cloud Marketplace, override the default behavior by modifying the `install-config.yaml` file to reference the location of Google Cloud Marketplace offer.

:::note

You should only modify the RHCOS image for compute machines to use a Google Cloud Marketplace image. Control plane machines and infrastructure nodes do not require an OpenShift Container Platform subscription and use the public RHCOS default image by default, which does not incur subscription costs on your Google Cloud bill. Therefore, you should not modify the cluster default boot image or the control plane boot images. Applying the Google Cloud Marketplace image to them will incur additional licensing costs that cannot be recovered.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

**Procedure**

1. Edit the `compute.platform.gcp.osImage` parameters to specify the location of the Google Cloud Marketplace image:
   - Set the `project` parameter to `redhat-marketplace-public`
   - Set the `name` parameter to one of the following offers:

   <dl>
   <dt>OpenShift Container Platform</dt>
   <dd><code>redhat-coreos-ocp-413-x86-64-202305021736</code></dd>
   <dt>OpenShift Platform Plus</dt>
   <dd><code>redhat-coreos-opp-413-x86-64-202305021736</code></dd>
   <dt>OpenShift Kubernetes Engine</dt>
   <dd><code>redhat-coreos-oke-413-x86-64-202305021736</code> 1.  Save the file and reference it when deploying the cluster.</dd>
   </dl>

```yaml title="Sample install-config.yaml file that specifies a Google Cloud Marketplace image for compute machines"
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
controlPlane:
# ...
compute:
  platform:
    gcp:
      osImage:
        project: redhat-marketplace-public
        name: redhat-coreos-ocp-413-x86-64-202305021736
# ...
```

## Network configuration phases {#nw-network-config_installing-gcp-customizations}

There are two phases prior to OpenShift Container Platform installation where you can customize the network configuration. Customize settings in the `install-config.yaml` file and in the Cluster Network Operator manifest across two configuration phases.

Phase 1
: You can customize the following network-related fields in the `install-config.yaml` file before you create the manifest files:

  - `networking.networkType`
  - `networking.clusterNetwork`
  - `networking.serviceNetwork`
  - `networking.machineNetwork`
  - `nodeNetworking`

  For more information, see "Installation configuration parameters".

  :::note

  Set the `networking.machineNetwork` to match the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) where the preferred subnet is located.

  :::

  :::warning

  The CIDR range `172.17.0.0/16` is reserved by `libVirt`. You cannot use any other CIDR range that overlaps with the `172.17.0.0/16` CIDR range for networks in your cluster.

  :::

Phase 2
: After creating the manifest files by running `openshift-install create manifests`, you can define a customized Cluster Network Operator manifest with only the fields you want to modify. You can use the manifest to specify an advanced network configuration.

During phase 2, you cannot override the values that you specified in phase 1 in the `install-config.yaml` file. However, you can customize the network plugin during phase 2.

## Specifying advanced network configuration {#modifying-nwoperator-config-startup_installing-gcp-customizations}

To integrate your OpenShift Container Platform cluster with your existing network environment, you can specify advanced network configuration in a manifest before you install the cluster. Advanced network configuration can be configured only during cluster installation.

:::warning

Customizing your network configuration by modifying the OpenShift Container Platform manifest files created by the installation program is not supported. Applying a manifest file that you create, as in the following procedure, is supported.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You have created the `install-config.yaml` file and completed any modifications to it.

**Procedure**

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:
   ```terminal
   $ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
   ```

   The `<installation_directory>` specifies the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.
2. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named `cluster-network-03-config.yml` in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
   kind: Network
   metadata:
     name: cluster
   spec:
   ```
3. Specify the advanced network configuration for your cluster in the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file, such as in the following example:
   ```yaml title="Enable IPsec for the OVN-Kubernetes network provider"
   apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
   kind: Network
   metadata:
     name: cluster
   spec:
     defaultNetwork:
       ovnKubernetesConfig:
         ipsecConfig:
           mode: Full
   ```
4. Optional: Back up the `manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml` file. The installation program consumes the `manifests/` directory when you create the Ignition config files.
5. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines and compute `MachineSets`:
   ```terminal
   $ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*.yaml
   ```

   Because you create and manage these resources yourself, you do not have to initialize them.

   - You can preserve the `MachineSet` files to create compute machines by using the machine API, but you must update references to them to match your environment.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration {#nw-operator-cr_installing-gcp-customizations}

To manage cluster networking, configure the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) `Network` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` so the cluster uses the correct IP ranges and network plugin settings for reliable pod and service connectivity. Some settings and fields are inherited at the time of install or by the `default.Network.type` plugin, OVN-Kubernetes.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the `Network` API in the `Network.config.openshift.io` API group:

`clusterNetwork`
: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.

`serviceNetwork`
: IP address pool for services.

`defaultNetwork.type`
: Cluster network plugin. `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported plugin during installation.

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the `defaultNetwork` object in the CNO object named `cluster`.

### Cluster Network Operator configuration object {#nw-operator-cr-cno-object_installing-gcp-customizations}

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:

**Cluster Network Operator configuration object**

:::warning

For a cluster that needs to deploy objects across multiple networks, ensure that you specify the same value for the `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter for each network type that is defined in the `install-config.yaml` file. Setting a different value for each `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter can impact the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, where the plugin cannot effectively route object traffic among different nodes.

## Deploying the cluster {#installation-launching-installer_installing-gcp-customizations}

To deploy your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can initialize installation by running the `openshift-install create cluster` command from the directory that contains the installation program. The installation program provisions infrastructure and completes cluster setup.

:::warning

You can run the `create cluster` command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
- You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
- You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

**Procedure**

1. Remove any existing Google Cloud credentials that do not use the service account key for the Google Cloud account that you configured for your cluster and that are stored in the following locations:
   - The `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON`, or `GCLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON` environment variables
   - The `~/.gcp/osServiceAccount.json` file
   - The `gcloud cli` default credentials
2. In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \
    --log-level=info
```

- For `<installation_directory>`, specify the location of your customized `./install-config.yaml` file.
- To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or `error` instead of `info`.
  1. Optional: You can reduce the number of permissions for the service account that you used to install the cluster.
- If you assigned the `Owner` role to your service account, you can remove that role and replace it with the `Viewer` role.
- If you included the `Service Account Key Admin` role, you can remove it.

**Verification**

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

- The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user.
- Credential information also outputs to `<installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log`.
  :::warning

  Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.

  :::

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  ...
  INFO Install complete!
  INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
  INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
  INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
  INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
  ```

  :::warning

  - The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
  - It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

## Provisioning your own DNS records {#installation-gcp-provisioning-own-dns-records_installing-gcp-customizations}

Use the IP address of the API server to provision your own DNS record with the `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain. Use the IP address of the Ingress service to provision your own DNS record with the `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain.

:::warning

Before you use this feature, you must add the `userProvisionedDNS` parameter to the `install-config.yaml` file and enable the parameter. For more information, see "Enabling a user-managed DNS".

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You installed your cluster.
- You installed the `gcloud` CLI tool.

**Procedure**

1. Determine the infrastructure ID of your cluster by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ infra_id=$(jq -r .infraID <installation_directory>/metadata.json)
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;installation_directory&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the directory where you ran the installation program.</dd>
   </dl>
2. Find the IP address of the API server:
   1. If you installed a private cluster, determine the IP address of the API server by running the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe "${infra_id}-api-internal" --project=<project_name> --region <region_name> --format json | jq -r .IPAddress
      ```

      where:

      <dl>
      <dt><code>&lt;project_name&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the name of your Google Cloud project.</dd>
      <dt><code>&lt;region_name&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the region where you installed your cluster.</dd>
      </dl>
   2. If you installed a public cluster, determine the IP address of the API server by running the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe --global "${infra_id}-apiserver" --format json | jq -r .IPAddress
      ```
3. Use the IP address to provision your own DNS record with the `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain.
4. Find the IP address of the Ingress service:
   1. If you installed a private cluster, find the IP address of the Ingress service by running the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --project=<project_name> --filter="subnetwork:(projects/<project_name>/regions/<region_name>/subnetworks/<compute_subnet_name>)" --format="json" | jq -r '.[].IPAddress'
      ```

      where:

      <dl>
      <dt><code>&lt;project_name&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the name of your Google Cloud project.</dd>
      <dt><code>&lt;region_name&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the region where you installed your cluster.</dd>
      <dt><code>&lt;compute_subnet_name&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the name of the subnet that contains your compute nodes.</dd>
      </dl>
   2. If you installed a public cluster, find the IP address by using the forwarding rule:
      1. Find the forwarding rule for the Ingress service by running the following command:
         ```terminal
         $ ingress_forwarding_rule=$(gcloud compute target-pools list --format=json --filter="instances[]~${infra_id}" | jq -r .[].name)
         ```
      2. Use the forwarding rule value to find the IP address of the Ingress service by running the following command:
         ```terminal
         $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe --region "<region_name>" "${ingress_forwarding_rule}" --format json | jq -r .IPAddress
         ```

         where:

         <dl>
         <dt><code>&lt;region_name&gt;</code></dt>
         <dd>Specifies the region where you installed your cluster.</dd>
         </dl>
5. Use the IP address to provision your own DNS record with the `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain.

## Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI {#cli-logging-in-kubeadmin_installing-gcp-customizations}

To log in to your cluster as the default system user, export the `kubeconfig` file. This configuration enables the CLI to authenticate and connect to the specific API server created during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

The `kubeconfig` file is specific to a cluster and OpenShift Container Platform generates it during installation.

**Prerequisites**

- You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
- You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

1. Export the `kubeadmin` credentials by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;installation_directory&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files.</dd>
   </dl>
2. Verify you can run `oc` commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc whoami
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   system:admin
   ```

## Telemetry access for OpenShift Container Platform {#cluster-telemetry_installing-gcp-customizations}

To provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, the Telemetry service requires internet access. When connected, this service runs automatically by default and registers your cluster to [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift).

After you confirm that your [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift) inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager,use subscription watch to track your OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level. For more information about subscription watch, see "Data Gathered and Used by Red Hat’s subscription services" in the *Additional resources* section.
