# Installing a cluster on IBM Power in a disconnected environment {#installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

<a id="installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power"></a>

You can install OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power(R) infrastructure that you provision in a disconnected environment by mirroring the required release images to an internal registry and then running the installation program.

:::warning

Additional considerations exist for non-bare metal platforms. Review the guidelines for deploying OpenShift Container Platform on non-tested platforms before you install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

:::

## Prerequisites for installing a cluster on IBM Power in a disconnected environment {#prereqs-ibm-power-upi-disconnected_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Before you install a OpenShift Container Platform cluster on IBM Power(R) in a restricted network, complete the prerequisite tasks to mirror images and prepare your environment.

- You reviewed details about the OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
- You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
- You created a mirror registry for installation in a restricted network and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of OpenShift Container Platform.
- Before you begin the installation process, you must move or remove any existing installation files. This ensures that the installation program creates and updates the required installation files.
  :::warning

  Perform installation steps on a machine with access to the installation media.

  :::
- You provisioned persistent storage using OpenShift Data Foundation or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with `ReadWriteMany` access.
- If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you configured the firewall to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.
  :::note

  Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.

## About installations in restricted networks {#installation-about-restricted-networks_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You can install OpenShift Container Platform 4.22 in a restricted network without an active internet connection to obtain software components. Restricted network installations can use installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on the cloud platform to which you are installing the cluster.

To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your closed network, or by using other methods that meet your restrictions.

:::warning

Because of the complexity of the configuration for user-provisioned installations, consider completing a standard user-provisioned infrastructure installation before you try a restricted network installation using user-provisioned infrastructure. Completing this test installation might make it easier to isolate and troubleshoot any issues that might arise during your installation in a restricted network.

:::

### Additional limits {#installation-restricted-network-limits_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions:

- The `ClusterVersion` status includes an `Unable to retrieve available updates` error.
- By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because you cannot access the required image stream tags.

## Internet access for OpenShift Container Platform {#cluster-entitlements_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.22, you require access to the internet to obtain the images that are necessary to install your cluster.

You must have internet access to perform the following actions:

- Access Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
- Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
- Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

## Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure {#ibm-power-upi-requirements-intro_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

For a OpenShift Container Platform cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure on IBM Power(R), you must deploy all required machines meeting the hardware, network, DNS, and load balancing requirements.

### Required machines for cluster installation {#installation-machine-requirements_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You must specify the minimum required machines or hosts for your cluster so that your cluster remains stable if a node fails.

The smallest OpenShift Container Platform clusters require the following hosts:

:::warning

For a cluster that has user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

:::

**Minimum required hosts**

| Hosts | Description |
| --- | --- |
| One temporary bootstrap machine | The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after you install the cluster. |
| Three control plane machines | The control plane machines run the Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform services that form the control plane. |
| At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines. | The workloads requested by OpenShift Container Platform users run on the compute machines. |

:::warning

To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for these cluster machines.

:::

The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system.

RHCOS is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.8 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements. See [Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits).

### Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation {#installation-minimum-resource-requirements_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To ensure that your OpenShift Container Platform cluster runs as expected, each cluster machine must meet minimum CPU, memory, and storage requirements.

- One vCPU is equal to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
- OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and Red Hat recommends faster storage, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes. On many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to provision more storage to get enough performance.

:::note

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.22, RHCOS uses RHEL version 9.8, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. Each architecture requires the following minimum instruction set architectures (ISA):

- x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
- ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
- ppc64le architecture requires IBM(R) Power9 ISA
- s390x architecture requires IBM(R) z14 ISA

For more information, see [Architectures](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/9.8_release_notes/index#architectures) in the RHEL documentation.

:::

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in OpenShift Container Platform.

#### Hardware requirements {#_hardware_requirements}

- Six LPARs across multiple PowerVM servers

#### Operating system requirements {#_operating_system_requirements}

- One instance of an IBM Power(R)9, IBM Power(R)10 or IBM Power(R)11 processor-based system

On your IBM Power(R) instance, set up:

- Three LPARs for OpenShift Container Platform control plane machines
- Two LPARs for OpenShift Container Platform compute machines
- One LPAR for the temporary OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap machine

#### Disk storage for the IBM Power guest virtual machines {#_disk_storage_for_the_ibm_power_title_guest_virtual_machines}

- Local storage, or storage provisioned by the Virtual I/O Server using vSCSI, NPIV (N-Port ID Virtualization) or SSP (shared storage pools)

#### Network for the PowerVM guest virtual machines {#_network_for_the_powervm_guest_virtual_machines}

- 120 GB / 32 GB for OpenShift Container Platform control plane machines
- 120 GB / 32 GB for OpenShift Container Platform compute machines
- 120 GB / 16 GB for the temporary OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap machine

### Certificate signing requests management {#csr-management_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

On user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation when your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management.

The `kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The `machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that kubelet credentials request because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must find and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

### Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure {#installation-network-user-infra_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You must configure networking for all the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines in `initramfs` during boot, so that they can fetch their Ignition config files.

During the initial boot, the machines require an IP address configuration that is set either through a DHCP server or statically by providing the required boot options. After a network connection is established, the machines download their Ignition config files from an HTTP or HTTPS server. The Ignition config files are then used to set the exact state of each machine. The Machine Config Operator completes more changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.

:::note

- Consider using a DHCP server for long-term management of the cluster machines. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP addresses, DNS server information, and hostnames to the cluster machines.
- If a DHCP service is not available for your user-provisioned infrastructure, you can instead provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the *Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process* section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.

:::

The Kubernetes API server must be able to resolve the node names of the cluster machines. If the API servers and worker nodes are in different zones, you can configure a default DNS search zone to allow the API server to resolve the node names. Another supported approach is to always refer to hosts by their fully-qualified domain names in both the node objects and all DNS requests.

#### Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP {#installation-host-names-dhcp-user-infra_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines, the hostname is set through NetworkManager. By default, the machines obtain their hostname through DHCP. If the hostname is not provided by DHCP, set statically through kernel arguments, or another method, it is obtained through a reverse DNS lookup. Reverse DNS lookup occurs after the network has been initialized on a node and can take time to resolve. Other system services can start before this and detect the hostname as `localhost` or similar. You can avoid this by using DHCP to provide the hostname for each cluster node.

Additionally, setting the hostnames through DHCP can bypass any manual DNS record name configuration errors in environments that have a DNS split-horizon implementation.

#### Network connectivity requirements {#installation-network-connectivity-user-infra_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the hostnames of all other machines in the cluster.

This section provides details about the ports that are required.

#### NTP configuration for user-provisioned infrastructure {#_ntp_configuration_for_user-provisioned_infrastructure}

OpenShift Container Platform clusters are configured to use a public Network Time Protocol (NTP) server by default. If you want to use a local enterprise NTP server, or if your cluster is being deployed in a disconnected network, you can configure the cluster to use a specific time server. For more information, see the documentation for *Configuring chrony time service*.

If a DHCP server provides NTP server information, the chrony time service on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines read the information and can sync the clock with the NTP servers.

**Additional resources**

### User-provisioned DNS requirements {#installation-dns-user-infra_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

In OpenShift Container Platform deployments, you must ensure that cluster components meet certain DNS name resolution criteria for internal communication, certificate validation, and automated node discovery purposes.

The following is a list of required cluster components:

- The Kubernetes API
- The OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard
- The bootstrap and control plane machines
- The compute machines

Reverse DNS resolution is also required for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution. The reverse records are important because Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) uses the reverse records to set the hostnames for all the nodes, unless the hostnames are provided by DHCP. Additionally, the reverse records are used to generate the certificate signing requests (CSR) that OpenShift Container Platform needs to operate.

:::note

It is recommended to use a DHCP server to provide the hostnames to each cluster node. See the *DHCP recommendations for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for more information.

:::

The following DNS records are required for a user-provisioned OpenShift Container Platform cluster and they must be in place before installation. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster name and `<base_domain>` is the base domain that you specify in the `install-config.yaml` file. A complete DNS record takes the form: `<component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.

:::note

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.4 and later, you do not need to specify etcd host and SRV records in your DNS configuration.

:::

:::tip

You can use the `dig` command to verify name and reverse name resolution. See the section on *Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure* for detailed validation steps.

:::

#### Example DNS configuration for user-provisioned clusters {#installation-dns-user-infra-example_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Reference the example DNS configurations to understand how A and PTR record configuration samples meet the DNS requirements for deploying OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure.

The DNS configuration examples provided here are for reference only and are not meant to provide advice for choosing one DNS solution over another.

In the examples, the cluster name is `ocp4` and the base domain is `example.com`.

The following example is a BIND zone file that shows sample DNS A records for name resolution in a user-provisioned cluster.

:::note

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

### Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure {#installation-load-balancing-user-infra_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, you must provision the API and application Ingress load balancing infrastructure. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

:::note

If you want to deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instance, you must purchase the RHEL subscription separately.

:::

The load balancing infrastructure must meet the following requirements:

- API load balancer: Provides a common endpoint for users, both human and machine, to interact with and configure the platform. Configure the following conditions:
  - Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
  - A stateless load balancing algorithm. The options vary based on the load balancer implementation.

  :::warning

  Do not configure session persistence for an API load balancer. Configuring session persistence for a Kubernetes API server might cause performance issues from excess application traffic for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the Kubernetes API that runs inside the cluster.

  :::

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the API load balancers:

| Port | Back-end machines (pool members) | Internal | External | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `6443` | Bootstrap and control plane. You remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer after the bootstrap machine initializes the cluster control plane. You must configure the `/readyz` endpoint for the API server health check probe. | X | X | Kubernetes API server |
| `22623` | Bootstrap and control plane. You remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer after the bootstrap machine initializes the cluster control plane. | X |  | Machine config server |

:::note

The load balancer must be configured to take a maximum of 30 seconds from the time the API server turns off the `/readyz` endpoint to the removal of the API server instance from the pool. Within the time frame after `/readyz` returns an error or becomes healthy, the endpoint must have been removed or added. Probing every 5 or 10 seconds, with two successful requests to become healthy and three to become unhealthy, are well-tested values.

:::

- Application Ingress load balancer: Provides an ingress point for application traffic flowing in from outside the cluster. A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Configure the following conditions:
  - Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
  - A connection-based or session-based persistence is recommended, based on the options available and types of applications that will be hosted on the platform.

  :::tip

  If the true IP address of the client can be seen by the application Ingress load balancer, enabling source IP-based session persistence can improve performance for applications that use end-to-end TLS encryption.

  :::

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:

**Application Ingress load balancer**

| Port | Back-end machines (pool members) | Internal | External | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `443` | The machines that run the Ingress Controller pods, compute, or worker, by default. | X | X | HTTPS traffic |
| `80` | The machines that run the Ingress Controller pods, compute, or worker, by default. | X | X | HTTP traffic |

:::note

If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.

:::

#### Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters {#installation-load-balancing-user-infra-example_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Reference the example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration so that you can understand how to meet the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters.

The sample is an `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.

:::tip

If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the `haproxy` process is listening on ports `6443`, `22623`, `443`, and `80` by running `netstat -nltupe` on the HAProxy node.

:::

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

:::note

If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to `enforcing`, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running `setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1`.

## Preparing the user-provisioned infrastructure {#installation-infrastructure-user-infra_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must prepare the underlying infrastructure.

This section provides details about the high-level steps required to set up your cluster infrastructure in preparation for an OpenShift Container Platform installation. This includes configuring IP networking and network connectivity for your cluster nodes, enabling the required ports through your firewall, and setting up the required DNS and load balancing infrastructure.

After preparation, your cluster infrastructure must meet the requirements outlined in the *Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure* section.

**Prerequisites**

- You have reviewed the [OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4128421) page.
- You have reviewed the infrastructure requirements detailed in the *Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure* section.

**Procedure**

1. If you are using DHCP to provide the IP networking configuration to your cluster nodes, configure your DHCP service.
   1. Add persistent IP addresses for the nodes to your DHCP server configuration. In your configuration, match the MAC address of the relevant network interface to the intended IP address for each node.
   2. When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the cluster machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. Define the persistent DNS server address that is used by the cluster nodes through your DHCP server configuration.
      :::note

      If you are not using a DHCP service, you must provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the *Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process* section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.

      :::
   3. Define the hostnames of your cluster nodes in your DHCP server configuration. See the *Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP* section for details about hostname considerations.
      :::note

      If you are not using a DHCP service, the cluster nodes obtain their hostname through a reverse DNS lookup.

      :::
2. Ensure that your network infrastructure provides the required network connectivity between the cluster components. See the *Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for details about the requirements.
3. Configure your firewall to enable the ports required for the OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. See *Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for details about the ports that are required.
   :::warning

   By default, port `1936` is accessible for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, because each control plane node needs access to this port.

   For ingress health check probes, the `/healthz/ready` endpoint is available on this port.

   Avoid using the Ingress load balancer to expose this port, because doing so might result in the exposure of sensitive information, such as statistics and metrics, related to Ingress Controllers.

   :::
4. Setup the required DNS infrastructure for your cluster.
   1. Configure DNS name resolution for the Kubernetes API, the application wildcard, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.
   2. Configure reverse DNS resolution for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.
      See the *User-provisioned DNS requirements* section for more information about the OpenShift Container Platform DNS requirements.
5. Validate your DNS configuration.
   1. From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses in the responses correspond to the correct components.
   2. From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names in the responses correspond to the correct components.
      See the *Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for detailed DNS validation steps.
6. Provision the required API and application ingress load balancing infrastructure. See the *Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for more information about the requirements.
   :::note

   Some load balancing solutions require the DNS name resolution for the cluster nodes to be in place before the load balancing is initialized.

   :::

## Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure {#installation-user-provisioned-validating-dns_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To prevent network-related installation failures and ensure node connectivity in OpenShift Container Platform, validate your DNS configuration before deploying on user-provisioned infrastructure.

:::warning

The validation steps detailed in this section must succeed before you install your cluster.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You have configured the required DNS records for your user-provisioned infrastructure.

**Procedure**

1. From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses contained in the responses correspond to the correct components.
   1. Perform a lookup against the Kubernetes API record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the API load balancer:
      ```terminal
      $ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
      ```

      Replace `<nameserver_ip>` with the IP address of the name server, `<cluster_name>` with your cluster name, and `<base_domain>` with your base domain name.

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      api.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
      ```
   2. Perform a lookup against the Kubernetes internal API record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the API load balancer:
      ```terminal
      $ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      api-int.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
      ```
   3. Test an example `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` DNS wildcard lookup. All of the application wildcard lookups must resolve to the IP address of the application ingress load balancer:
      ```terminal
      $ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> random.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      random.apps.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
      ```

      :::note

      In the example outputs, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

      :::

      You can replace `random` with another wildcard value. For example, you can query the route to the OpenShift Container Platform console:

      ```terminal
      $ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com. 604800 IN	A 192.168.1.5
      ```
   4. Run a lookup against the bootstrap DNS record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the bootstrap node:
      ```terminal
      $ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> bootstrap.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      bootstrap.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.96
      ```
   5. Use this method to perform lookups against the DNS record names for the control plane and compute nodes. Check that the results correspond to the IP addresses of each node.
2. From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names contained in the responses correspond to the correct components.
   1. Perform a reverse lookup against the IP address of the API load balancer. Check that the response includes the record names for the Kubernetes API and the Kubernetes internal API:
      ```terminal
      $ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> -x 192.168.1.5
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      5.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	api-int.ocp4.example.com.
      5.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	api.ocp4.example.com.
      ```

      where:

      <dl>
      <dt><code>api-int.ocp4.example.com</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the record name for the Kubernetes internal API.</dd>
      <dt><code>api.ocp4.example.com</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the record name for the Kubernetes API.</dd>
      </dl>

      :::note

      A PTR record is not required for the OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard. No validation step is needed for reverse DNS resolution against the IP address of the application ingress load balancer.

      :::
   2. Perform a reverse lookup against the IP address of the bootstrap node. Check that the result points to the DNS record name of the bootstrap node:
      ```terminal
      $ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> -x 192.168.1.96
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      96.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	bootstrap.ocp4.example.com.
      ```
   3. Use this method to perform reverse lookups against the IP addresses for the control plane and compute nodes. Check that the results correspond to the DNS record names of each node.

## Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access {#ssh-agent-using_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

During an OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

The key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node, which enables password-less authentication. After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user `core`. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The `./openshift-install gather` command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

:::warning

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.

:::

:::note

You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches.

:::

**Procedure**

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>
   ```

   Specifies the path and file name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your `~/.ssh` directory.

   :::note

   If you plan to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures, do not create a key that uses the `ed25519` algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the `rsa` or `ecdsa` algorithm.

   :::
2. View the public SSH key:
   ```terminal
   $ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
   ```

   For example, run the following to view the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` public key:

   ```terminal
   $ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the `./openshift-install gather` command.
   :::note

   On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are managed automatically.

   :::

   1. If the `ssh-agent` process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:
      ```terminal
      $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      Agent pid 31874
      ```

      :::note

      If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.

      :::
4. Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:
   ```terminal
   $ ssh-add <path>/<file_name>
   ```

   Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`.

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
   ```

**Next steps**

- When you install OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

## Manually creating the installation configuration file {#installation-initializing-manual_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file.

**Prerequisites**

- You have an SSH public key on your local machine for use with the installation program. You can use the key for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.
- You have obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

**Procedure**

1. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:
   ```terminal
   $ mkdir <installation_directory>
   ```

   :::warning

   You must create a directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.

   :::
2. Customize the provided sample `install-config.yaml` file template and save the file in the `<installation_directory>`.
   :::note

   You must name this configuration file `install-config.yaml`.

   :::
3. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install many clusters.
   :::warning

   Back up the `install-config.yaml` file now, because the installation process consumes the file in the next step.

where:

`baseDomain`
: Specifies the base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this base and include the cluster name.

`compute`
: Specifies the `compute` node configurations, which is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`.

`controlPlane`
: Specifies the `controlPlane` node configurations, which is a single mapping. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.

`hyperthreading`
: Specifies simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which you configure as a post-installation task.

`compute.replicas`
: Specifies the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you on installer-provisioned installations. You must set this value to `0` when you install OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure. Additionally for user-provisioned installations, you must manually deploy the compute machines before you finish installing the cluster.

:::note

If you are installing a three-node cluster, do not deploy any compute machines when you install the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines.

:::

`controlPlane.replicas`
: Specifies the number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because the cluster uses these values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.

`metadata.name`
: Specifies the cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.

`networking.clusterNetwork.cidr`
: Specifies a block of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. These IP addresses are used for the pod network. If you need to access the pods from an external network, you must configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

:::note

Class E CIDR range is reserved for a future use. To use the Class E CIDR range, you must ensure your networking environment accepts the IP addresses within the Class E CIDR range.

:::

`networking.cidr.hostPrefix`
: Specifies the subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if `hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of the given `cidr`, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses. If you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

`networking.networkType`
: Specifies the cluster network plugin to install. The default value `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported value.

`networking.serviceNetwork`
: Specifies the IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only one IP address pool. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. If you need to access the services from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

`platform`
: Specifies the platform. You must set the platform to `none`. You cannot provide additional platform configuration variables for IBM Power(R) infrastructure.

:::warning

Clusters that are installed with the platform type `none` are unable to use some features, such as managing compute machines with the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that would normally support the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.

:::

`fips`
: Specifies either enabling or disabling FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

:::warning

To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see [Switching RHEL to FIPS mode](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/switching-rhel-to-fips-mode_security-hardening).

When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

:::

`pullSecret`:: Specifies the registry domain name for `<local_registry>`, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example, `registry.example.com` or `registry.example.com:5000`. For `<credentials>`, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.

`sshKey`:: Specifies the SSH public key for the `core` user in Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

:::note

For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

:::

`additionalTrustBundle`
: Specifies the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry.

`imageContentSources`:: Specifies the `imageContentSources` section according to the output of the command that you used to mirror the repository.

:::warning

- When using the `oc adm release mirror` command, use the output from the `imageContentSources` section.
- When using `oc mirror` command, use the `repositoryDigestMirrors` section of the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file that results from running the command.
- `ImageContentSourcePolicy` is deprecated. For more information see *Configuring image registry repository mirroring*.

### Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation {#installation-configure-proxy_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file.

**Prerequisites**

- You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.
- You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, the proxy handles all cluster egress traffic, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object’s `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary.
  :::note

  The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field includes the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration.

  For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field also includes the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).

  :::

**Procedure**

1. Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   baseDomain: my.domain.com
   proxy:
     httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
     httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
     noProxy: example.com
   additionalTrustBundle: |
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
       -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
   # ...
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>proxy.httpProxy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be <code>http</code>.</dd>
   <dt><code>proxy.httpsProxy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.</dd>
   <dt><code>proxy.noProxy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with <code>.</code> to match subdomains only. For example, <code>.y.com</code> matches <code>x.y.com</code>, but not <code>y.com</code>. Use <code>*</code> to bypass the proxy for all destinations.</dd>
   <dt><code>additionalTrustBundle</code></dt>
   <dd>If you specify this value, the installation program generates a config map named <code>user-ca-bundle</code> in the <code>openshift-config</code> namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you specify <code>additionalTrustBundle</code> and at least one proxy setting, the <code>Proxy</code> object references the <code>user-ca-bundle</code> config map in the <code>trustedCA</code> field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a <code>trusted-ca-bundle</code> config map that merges the contents specified for the <code>trustedCA</code> parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. You must set the <code>additionalTrustBundle</code> field unless an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle signs the proxy’s identity certificate.</dd>
   <dt><code>additionalTrustBundlePolicy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the <code>Proxy</code> object to reference the <code>user-ca-bundle</code> config map in the <code>trustedCA</code> field. The allowed values are <code>Proxyonly</code> and <code>Always</code>. Use <code>Proxyonly</code> to reference the <code>user-ca-bundle</code> config map only when you configure an <code>http/https</code> proxy. Use <code>Always</code> to always reference the <code>user-ca-bundle</code> config map. The default value is <code>Proxyonly</code>. Optional parameter.</dd>
   </dl>

   :::note

   The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field.

   :::

   :::note

   If the installation program times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installation program. For example:

   ```terminal
   $ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
   ```

   :::
2. Save the file and reference it when installing OpenShift Container Platform.
   The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy named `cluster` that uses the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. If you do not give proxy settings, the installation program still creates a `cluster` `Proxy` object, but it has a nil `spec`.

   :::note

   Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and you cannot create additional proxies.

   :::

### Configuring a three-node cluster {#installation-three-node-cluster_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To create smaller, resource-efficient clusters for testing and production, deploy a bare-metal cluster with zero compute machines. This optional configuration uses only three control plane machines, optimizing infrastructure resources for administrators and developers.

In three-node OpenShift Container Platform environments, the three control plane machines are schedulable, which means that your application workloads run on them.

**Prerequisites**

- You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

**Procedure**

- Ensure that the number of compute replicas is set to `0` in your `install-config.yaml` file, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:
  ```yaml
  compute:
  - name: worker
    platform: {}
    replicas: 0
  # ...
  ```

  :::note

  You must set the value of the `replicas` parameter for the compute machines to `0` when you install OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure, regardless of the number of compute machines you deploy. In installer-provisioned installations, the parameter controls the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you. This does not apply to user-provisioned installations, where you deploy the compute machines manually.

  :::

  **Next steps**

For three-node cluster installations, follow these next steps:

- If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes. See the *Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for more information.
- When you create the Kubernetes manifest files in the following procedure, ensure that the `mastersSchedulable` parameter in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file is set to `true`. This enables your application workloads to run on the control plane nodes.
- Do not deploy any compute nodes when you create the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration {#nw-operator-cr_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To manage cluster networking, configure the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) `Network` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` so the cluster uses the correct IP ranges and network plugin settings for reliable pod and service connectivity.

Some settings and fields are inherited at the time of install or by the `default.Network.type` plugin, OVN-Kubernetes.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the `Network` API in the `Network.config.openshift.io` API group:

`clusterNetwork`
: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.

`serviceNetwork`
: IP address pool for services.

`defaultNetwork.type`
: Cluster network plugin. `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported plugin during installation.

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the `defaultNetwork` object in the CNO object named `cluster`.

### Cluster Network Operator configuration object {#nw-operator-cr-cno-object_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:

:::warning

For a cluster that needs to deploy objects across multiple networks, ensure that you specify the same value for the `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter for each network type that is defined in the `install-config.yaml` file. Setting a different value for each `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter can impact the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, where the plugin cannot effectively route object traffic among different nodes.

## Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files {#installation-user-infra-generate-k8s-manifest-ignition_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

Because you manually provision infrastructure, you must generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster requires.

The installation program converts the installation configuration into Kubernetes manifests and then wraps them into Ignition configuration files. You use these Ignition files to configure the cluster machines.

:::warning

- The Ignition config files that the OpenShift Container Platform installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which the system then renews. If you shut down the cluster before the system renews the certificates and you later restart the cluster after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
- Use Ignition config files within 12 hours after you generate them, because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after you install the cluster. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

:::

:::note

The installation program that generates the manifest and Ignition files is architecture specific. You can obtain it from the [client image mirror](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/ppc64le/clients/ocp/latest/). The Linux version of the installation program (without an architecture postfix) runs on ppc64le only. This installation program is also available as a macOS version.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program. For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.
- You created the `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file.

**Procedure**

1. Change to the directory that contains the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
   ```terminal
   $ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;installation_directory&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the installation directory that contains the <code>install-config.yaml</code> file you created.</dd>
   </dl>

   :::warning

   If you are installing a three-node cluster, skip the following step to allow the control plane nodes to be schedulable.

   :::

   :::warning

   When you configure control plane nodes from the default unschedulable to schedulable, you require additional subscriptions because control plane nodes then become compute nodes.

   :::
2. Verify that the `mastersSchedulable` parameter in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` Kubernetes manifest file is set to `false`. This setting prevents pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines:
   1. Open the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file.
   2. Locate the `mastersSchedulable` parameter and verify that it is set to `false`.
   3. Save and exit the file.
3. To create the Ignition configuration files, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:
   ```terminal
   $ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir <installation_directory>
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;installation_directory&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the same installation directory. The installation program creates Ignition config files for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes in the installation directory. The program also creates the <code>kubeadmin-password</code> and <code>kubeconfig</code> files in the <code>./&lt;installation_directory&gt;/auth</code> directory:</dd>
   </dl>

   ```
   .
   ├── auth
   │   ├── kubeadmin-password

   ```

## Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process {#ibm-power-upi-installing-rhcos-intro_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To install OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power(R) infrastructure that you provision, you must install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) on the machines by using an ISO image or network PXE booting.

To install RHCOS, you must give the Ignition config file generated by the OpenShift Container Platform installation program for the type of machine you are installing. If you have configured suitable networking, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure, the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process begins automatically after the RHCOS machines have rebooted.

Follow either the steps to use an ISO image or network PXE booting to install RHCOS on the machines.

### Installing RHCOS by using an ISO image {#installation-user-infra-machines-iso_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To provision physical or virtual machines, install RHCOS by using a bootable ISO image.

**Prerequisites**

- You have created the Ignition config files for your cluster.
- You have configured a suitable network, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure.
- You have an HTTP server that can be accessed from your computer, and from the machines that you create.
- You have reviewed the *Advanced RHCOS installation configuration* section for different ways to configure features, such as networking and disk partitioning.

**Procedure**

1. Obtain the SHA512 digest for each of your Ignition config files. For example, you can use the following on a system running Linux to get the SHA512 digest for your `bootstrap.ign` Ignition config file:
   ```terminal
   $ sha512sum <installation_directory>/bootstrap.ign
   ```

   The digests are provided to the `coreos-installer` in a later step to validate the authenticity of the Ignition config files on the cluster nodes.
2. Upload the bootstrap, control plane, and compute node Ignition config files that the installation program created to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.
   :::warning

   You can add or change configuration settings in your Ignition configs before saving them to your HTTP server. If you plan to add more compute machines to your cluster after you finish installation, do not delete these files.

   :::
3. From the installation host, validate that the Ignition config files are available on the URLs. The following example gets the Ignition config file for the bootstrap node:
   ```terminal

4. Although it is possible to obtain the RHCOS images that are required for your preferred method of installing operating system instances from the
   [RHCOS image mirror](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/ppc64le/dependencies/rhcos/) page, the recommended way to obtain the correct version of your RHCOS images are from the output of `openshift-install` command:

   ```terminal
   $ openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | grep '\.iso[^.]'
   ```

   **Example output**

   ```terminal
   "location": "<url>/art/storage/releases/rhcos-4.22-aarch64/<release>/aarch64/rhcos-<release>-live.aarch64.iso",
   "location": "<url>/art/storage/releases/rhcos-4.22-ppc64le/<release>/ppc64le/rhcos-<release>-live.ppc64le.iso",
   "location": "<url>/art/storage/releases/rhcos-4.22-s390x/<release>/s390x/rhcos-<release>-live.s390x.iso",
   "location": "<url>/art/storage/releases/rhcos-4.22/<release>/x86_64/rhcos-<release>-live.x86_64.iso",
   ```

   :::warning

   The RHCOS images might not change with every release of OpenShift Container Platform. You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal to the OpenShift Container Platform version that you install. Use the image versions that match your OpenShift Container Platform version if they are available. Use only ISO images for this procedure. RHCOS qcow2 images are not supported for this installation type.

   :::

   ISO file names resemble the following example:

   `rhcos-<version>-live.<architecture>.iso`
5. Use the ISO to start the RHCOS installation. Use one of the following installation options:
   - Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
   - Use ISO redirection by using a lights-out management (LOM) interface.
6. Boot the RHCOS ISO image without specifying any options or interrupting the live boot sequence. Wait for the installer to boot into a shell prompt in the RHCOS live environment.
   :::note

   It is possible to interrupt the RHCOS installation boot process to add kernel arguments. However, for this ISO procedure you should use the `coreos-installer` command as outlined in the following steps, instead of adding kernel arguments.

   :::
7. Run the `coreos-installer` command and specify the options that meet your installation requirements. At a minimum, you must specify the URL that points to the Ignition config file for the node type, and the device that you are installing to:
   ```terminal
   $ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://<HTTP_server>/<node_type>.ign <device> \
   --ignition-hash=sha512-<digest>
   ```

   - `<device>`: You must run the `coreos-installer` command by using `sudo`, because the `core` user does not have the required root privileges to perform the installation.
   - `<digest>`: The `--ignition-hash` option is required when the Ignition config file is obtained through an HTTP URL to validate the authenticity of the Ignition config file on the cluster node. `<digest>` is the Ignition config file SHA512 digest obtained in a preceding step.
     :::note

     If you want to provide your Ignition config files through an HTTPS server that uses TLS, you can add the internal certificate authority (CA) to the system trust store before running `coreos-installer`.

     :::

     The following example initializes a bootstrap node installation to the `/dev/sda` device. The Ignition config file for the bootstrap node is obtained from an HTTP web server with the IP address 192.168.1.2:

     ```terminal
     $ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://192.168.1.2:80/installation_directory/bootstrap.ign /dev/sda \
     --ignition-hash=sha512-a5a2d43879223273c9b60af66b44202a1d1248fc01cf156c46d4a79f552b6bad47bc8cc78ddf0116e80c59d2ea9e32ba53bc807afbca581aa059311def2c3e3b
     ```
8. Monitor the progress of the RHCOS installation on the console of the machine.
   :::warning

   Be sure that the installation is successful on each node before commencing with the OpenShift Container Platform installation. Observing the installation process can also help to determine the cause of RHCOS installation issues that might arise.

   :::
9. After RHCOS installs, you must reboot the system. During the system reboot, it applies the Ignition config file that you specified.
10. Check the console output to verify that Ignition ran.
    ```terminal title="Example command"
    Ignition: ran on 2022/03/14 14:48:33 UTC (this boot)
    Ignition: user-provided config was applied
    ```
11. Continue to create the other machines for your cluster.
    :::warning

    You must create the bootstrap and control plane machines at this time. If the control plane machines are not made schedulable, also create at least two compute machines before you install OpenShift Container Platform.

    :::

    If the required network, DNS, and load balancer infrastructure are in place, the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process begins automatically after the RHCOS nodes have rebooted.

    :::note

    RHCOS nodes do not include a default password for the `core` user. You can access the nodes by running `ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` as a user with access to the SSH private key that is paired to the public key that you specified in your `install_config.yaml` file. OpenShift Container Platform 4 cluster nodes running RHCOS are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes by using SSH is not recommended. However, when investigating installation issues, if the OpenShift Container Platform API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on a target node, SSH access might be required for debugging or disaster recovery.

### Networking and bonding options for ISO installations {#installation-user-infra-machines-routing-bonding_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You can configure advanced options so that you can modify the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) manual installation process. The subsequent sections show examples of networking options for an ISO installation.

If you install RHCOS from an ISO image, you can add kernel arguments manually when you boot the image to configure networking for a node. If no networking arguments are specified, DHCP is activated in the initramfs when RHCOS detects that networking is required to fetch the Ignition config file.

:::warning

When adding networking arguments manually, you must also add the `rd.neednet=1` kernel argument to bring the network up in the initramfs.

:::

The following information provides examples for configuring networking and bonding on your RHCOS nodes for ISO installations. The examples describe how to use the `ip=`, `nameserver=`, and `bond=` kernel arguments.

:::note

Ordering is important when adding the kernel arguments: `ip=`, `nameserver=`, and then `bond=`.

:::

The networking options are passed to the `dracut` tool during system boot. For more information about the networking options supported by `dracut`, see `dracut.cmdline` manual page.

#### Configuring DHCP or static IP addresses {#configuring-dhcp-or-static-ip-addresses_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You can configure an IP address by using either DHCP or an individual static IP address. If you set a static IP, you must then identify the DNS server IP address on each node.

The configuration examples in the procedure, update the IP addresses for the following components:

- The node’s IP address to `10.10.10.2`
- The gateway address to `10.10.10.254`
- The netmask to `255.255.255.0`
- The hostname to `core0.example.com`
- The DNS server address to `4.4.4.41`
- The auto-configuration value to `none`. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically.

**Procedure**

1. Enter a command like the following command to configure a static IP address:
   ```terminal
   ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
   nameserver=4.4.4.41
   ```
2. Enter a command like the following command to configure a DHCP IP address:
   ```terminal
   ip=enp1s0:dhcp
   ```

   :::note

   When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the RHCOS machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. For DHCP-based deployments, you can define the DNS server address that is used by the RHCOS nodes through your DHCP server configuration.

   :::
3. If two or more network interfaces and only one interface exists, disable DHCP on a single interface. In the example, the `enp1s0` interface has a static networking configuration and DHCP is disabled for `enp2s0`, which is not used:
   ```terminal
   ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
   ip=::::core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
   ```
4. If you need to combine DHCP and static IP configurations on systems with multiple network interfaces, run the following example command:
   ```terminal
   ip=enp1s0:dhcp
   ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
   ```

#### Configuring an IP address without a static hostname {#configuring-ip-address-without-static-hostname_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You can configure an IP address without assigning a static hostname. If a static hostname is not set by the user, the static hostname gets picked up and automatically set by a reverse DNS lookup.

The configuration examples in the procedure, update the IP addresses for the following components:

- The node’s IP address to `10.10.10.2`
- The gateway address to `10.10.10.254`
- The netmask to `255.255.255.0`
- The DNS server address to `4.4.4.41`
- The auto-configuration value to `none`. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically.

**Procedure**

- To configure an IP address without a static hostname, enter a command like the following command:
  ```terminal
  ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0::enp1s0:none
  nameserver=4.4.4.41
  ```

#### Specifying multiple network interfaces and DNS servers {#specifying-multiple-network-interfaces_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You can specify multiple network interfaces by setting multiple `ip=` entries. You can provide multiple DNS servers by adding a `nameserver=` entry for each server,

**Procedure**

- To specify multiple network interfaces for your interfaces, you can enter a command like the following command:
  ```terminal
  ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
  ip=10.10.10.3::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
  ```
- To provide multiple DNS servers by adding a `nameserver=` entry for each server, enter a command like the following command:
  ```terminal
  nameserver=1.1.1.1
  nameserver=8.8.8.8
  ```

#### Configuring default gateway and route {#configuring-default-gateway-route_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

As an optional task, you can configure routes to additional networks by setting an `rd.route=` value.

:::note

When you configure one or multiple networks, one default gateway is required. If the additional network gateway is different from the primary network gateway, the default gateway must be the primary network gateway.

:::

**Procedure**

- To configure the default gateway, enter the following command:
  ```terminal
  ip=::10.10.10.254::::
  ```
- To configure the route for an additional network, enter the following command:
  ```terminal
  rd.route=20.20.20.0/24:20.20.20.254:enp2s0
  ```

#### Configuring VLANs on individual interfaces {#configuring-vlans-individual-interfaces_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

As an optional task, you can configure VLANs on individual interfaces by using the `vlan=` parameter.

**Procedure**

- To configure a VLAN on a network interface and use a static IP address, run the following command:
  ```terminal
  ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0.100:none
  vlan=enp2s0.100:enp2s0
  ```
- To configure a VLAN on a network interface and to use DHCP, run the following command:
  ```terminal
  ip=enp2s0.100:dhcp
  vlan=enp2s0.100:enp2s0
  ```

#### Bonding multiple network interfaces to a single interface {#bonding-multiple-network-interfaces-to-single-interface_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

As an optional task, you can bond multiple network interfaces to a single interface by using the `bond=` option.

The following example demonstrates editing the `/etc/config/network` file and specifying the following syntax for bonding multiple network interfaces to a single interface:

```terminal
bond=<name>[:<network_interfaces>][:<options>]
```

- `<name>`: Specifies the bonding device name, for example `bond0`.
- `<network_interfaces>`: Specifies a comma-separated list of physical (ethernet) interfaces, such as `em1,em2`.
- ` <options>: Specifies a comma-separated list of bonding options. Enter the  `modinfo bonding` command to see available options.

When you create a bonded interface using the `bond=` command, you must specify how the IP address is assigned and other information for the bonded interface.

**Procedure**

- To configure the bonded interface to use DHCP, edit the `/etc/config/network` file by setting the IP address for the bond to `dhcp`. For example:
  ```terminal
  ip=bond0:dhcp
  ```
- To configure the bonded interface to use a static IP address, edit the `/etc/config/network` file entering the specific IP address you want and related information. For example:
  ```terminal
  ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:bond0:none
  ```

#### Bonding multiple SR-IOV network interfaces to a dual port NIC interface {#bonding-multiple-sriov-network-interfaces-to-dual-port_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You can bond multiple SR-IOV network interfaces to a dual port NIC interface by using the `bond=` option. Ensure you apply the procedure tasks to each node.

**Procedure**

1. Create the SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) following the guidance in [Managing SR-IOV devices](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_managing_virtualization/managing-virtual-devices_configuring-and-managing-virtualization#managing-sr-iov-devices_managing-virtual-devices). Follow the procedure in the "Attaching SR-IOV networking devices to virtual machines" section.
2. Create the bond, attach the desired VFs to the bond and set the bond link state up following the guidance in [Configuring network bonding](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/configuring-network-bonding_configuring-and-managing-networking). Follow any of the described procedures to create the bond.
   The following examples illustrate the syntax you must use:

   - The syntax for configuring a bonded interface is `bond=<name>[:<network_interfaces>][:options]`.
     `<name>` is the bonding device name (`bond0`), `<network_interfaces>` represents the virtual functions (VFs) by their known name in the kernel and shown in the output of the `ip link` command(`eno1f0`, `eno2f0`), and *options* is a comma-separated list of bonding options. Enter `modinfo bonding` to see available options.
   - When you create a bonded interface using `bond=`, you must specify how the IP address is assigned and other information for the bonded interface.
     - To configure the bonded interface to use DHCP, set the bond’s IP address to `dhcp`. For example:
       ```terminal
       bond=bond0:eno1f0,eno2f0:mode=active-backup
       ip=bond0:dhcp::AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
       ip=eno1f0:none::AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
       ip=eno2f0:none::AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
       ```
     - To configure the bonded interface to use a static IP address, enter the specific IP address you want and related information. For example:
       ```terminal
       bond=bond0:eno1f0,eno2f0:mode=active-backup
       ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:bond0:none
       ```

### Installing RHCOS by using PXE booting {#_installing_op_system_by_using_pxe_booting}

You can use PXE booting to install RHCOS on the machines.

**Prerequisites**

- You have created the Ignition config files for your cluster.
- You have configured a suitable network, DNS and load balancing infrastructure.
- You have configured suitable PXE infrastructure.
- You have an HTTP server that can be accessed from your computer, and from the machines that you create.
- You have reviewed the *Advanced RHCOS installation configuration* section for different ways to configure features, such as networking and disk partitioning.

**Procedure**

1. Upload the bootstrap, control plane, and compute node Ignition config files that the installation program created to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.
   :::warning

   You can add or change configuration settings in your Ignition configs before saving them to your HTTP server. If you plan to add more compute machines to your cluster after you finish installation, do not delete these files.

   :::
2. From the installation host, validate that the Ignition config files are available on the URLs. The following example gets the Ignition config file for the bootstrap node:
   ```terminal
   $ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/bootstrap.ign
   ```

   - `<HTTP_server>`: Replace `bootstrap.ign` with `master.ign` or `worker.ign` in the command to validate that the Ignition config files for the control plane and compute nodes are also available.
     ```terminal title="Example output"
       % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

     ```
3. Although it is possible to obtain the RHCOS `kernel`, `initramfs` and `rootfs` files that are required for your preferred method of installing operating system instances from the
   [RHCOS image mirror](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/ppc64le/dependencies/rhcos/) page, the recommended way to obtain the correct version of your RHCOS files are from the output of `openshift-install` command:

   ```terminal
   $ openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | grep -Eo '"https.*(kernel-|initramfs.|rootfs.)\w+(\.img)?"'

   - `initramfs`: `rhcos-<version>-live-initramfs.<architecture>.img`
   - `rootfs`: `rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img`
4. Upload the `rootfs`, `kernel`, and `initramfs` files to your HTTP server.
   :::warning

   If you plan to add more compute machines to your cluster after you finish installation, do not delete these files.

   :::
5. Configure the network boot infrastructure so that the machines boot from their local disks after RHCOS is installed on them.

### Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS {#rhcos-enabling-multipathday-1-power_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

During installation, you can enable multipathing for provisioned nodes on IBM Power(R). RHCOS supports multipathing on the primary disk, providing stronger resilience to hardware failure.

During the initial cluster creation, you might want to add kernel arguments to all control plane or worker nodes. To add kernel arguments to control plane or worker nodes, you can create a `MachineConfig` object and inject that object into the set of manifest files used by Ignition during cluster setup.

**Procedure**

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
   ```terminal
   $ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
   ```
2. Decide if you want to add kernel arguments to worker or control plane nodes.
   - Create a machine config file. For example, create a `99-master-kargs-mpath.yaml` that instructs the cluster to add the control plane label and identify the multipath kernel argument:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
     kind: MachineConfig
     metadata:
       labels:
         machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "master"
       name: 99-master-kargs-mpath
     spec:
       kernelArguments:
         - 'rd.multipath=default'
         - 'root=/dev/disk/by-label/dm-mpath-root'
     ```
3. To enable multipathing on worker nodes:
   - Create a machine config file. For example, create a `99-worker-kargs-mpath.yaml` that instructs the cluster to add the compute label and identify the multipath kernel argument:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
     kind: MachineConfig
     metadata:
       labels:
         machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker"
       name: 99-worker-kargs-mpath
     spec:
       kernelArguments:
         - 'rd.multipath=default'
         - 'root=/dev/disk/by-label/dm-mpath-root'
     ```

     You can now continue on to create the cluster.

     :::warning

     Additional postinstallation steps are required to fully enable multipathing. For more information, see "Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS" in *Postinstallation machine configuration tasks*.

     :::

     In case of MPIO failure, use the `bootlist` command to update the boot device list with alternate logical device names. The command displays a boot list and designates the possible boot devices for when the system is booted in normal mode.
4. To display a boot list and specify the possible boot devices if the system is booted in normal mode, enter the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ bootlist -m normal -o
   sda
   ```
5. To update the boot list for normal mode and add alternate device names, enter the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ bootlist -m normal -o /dev/sdc /dev/sdd /dev/sde
   sdc
   sdd
   sde
   ```

   If the original boot disk path is down, the node reboots from the alternate device registered in the normal boot device list.

## Waiting for the bootstrap process to complete {#installation-installing-bare-metal_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

After your cluster nodes first boot into the persistent RHCOS environment installed to disk, wait for the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process to complete.

The configuration information provided through the Ignition config files is used to initialize the bootstrap process and install OpenShift Container Platform on the machines.

**Prerequisites**

- You have created the Ignition config files for your cluster.
- You have configured suitable network, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure.
- You have obtained the installation program and generated the Ignition config files for your cluster.
- You installed RHCOS on your cluster machines and provided the Ignition config files that the OpenShift Container Platform installation program generated.

**Procedure**

1. Monitor the bootstrap process:
   ```terminal
   $ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for bootstrap-complete \
       --log-level=info
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;installation_directory&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files.</dd>
   <dt><code>--log-level=info</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies <code>warn</code>, <code>debug</code>, or <code>error</code> instead of <code>info</code> to view different installation details.</dd>
   </dl>

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   INFO Waiting up to 20m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.test.example.com:6443...
   INFO API v1.35.4 up
   INFO Waiting up to 1h0m0s for bootstrapping to complete...
   INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources
   ```

   The bootstrapping completion wait time varies per platform. The command succeeds when the Kubernetes API server signals that it has been bootstrapped on the control plane machines.
2. After the bootstrap process is complete, remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer.
   :::warning

   You must remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer at this point. You can also remove or reformat the bootstrap machine itself.

   :::

## Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI {#cli-logging-in-kubeadmin_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To log in to your cluster as the default system user, export the `kubeconfig` file. This configuration enables the CLI to authenticate and connect to the specific API server created during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

The `kubeconfig` file is specific to a cluster and OpenShift Container Platform generates it during installation.

**Prerequisites**

- You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
- You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

1. Export the `kubeadmin` credentials by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;installation_directory&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files.</dd>
   </dl>
2. Verify you can run `oc` commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc whoami
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   system:admin
   ```

**Next steps**

- "Customize your cluster"
- "Remote health reporting"

## Approve the certificate signing requests for your machines {#installation-approve-csrs_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To allow newly added machines to join your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, confirm that the cluster approves pending certificate signing requests (CSRs), or approve them yourself. Approve client requests first, then server requests.

**Prerequisites**

- You added machines to your cluster.

**Procedure**

1. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
   master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.35.4
   master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.35.4
   master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.35.4
   ```

   The output lists all of the machines that you created.

   :::note

   The preceding output might not include the compute nodes until you approve some CSRs.

   :::
2. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get csr
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
   csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
   csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
   ...
   ```

   In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.
3. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
   :::note

   You must approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates rotate, and more than two certificates are present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After you approve the client CSR, the kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. The `machine-approver` then automatically approves later serving certificate renewal requests if the kubelet requests a new certificate with the same parameters.

   :::

   :::note

   For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If you do not approve a request, the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because the API server requires a serving certificate when it connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups submitted the CSR, and confirm the identity of the node.

   :::

   - To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
     ```terminal
     $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
     ```

     where:

     <dl>
     <dt><code>&lt;csr_name&gt;</code></dt>
     <dd>Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.</dd>
     </dl>
   - To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
     ```terminal
     $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
     ```

     :::note

     Some Operators might not become available until you approve some CSRs. Each node submits two CSRs, so you might need to run the command to approve CSRs many times.

     :::
4. After you approve your client requests, review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get csr
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
   csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
   csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
   ...
   ```
5. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
   - To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
     ```terminal
     $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
     ```

     where:

     <dl>
     <dt><code>&lt;csr_name&gt;</code></dt>
     <dd>Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.</dd>
     </dl>
   - To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
     ```terminal
     $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
     ```
6. After you approve all client and server CSRs, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
   master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.35.4
   master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.35.4
   master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.35.4
   worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.35.4
   worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.35.4
   ```

   :::note

   You might need to wait a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to reach the `Ready` status.

   :::

## Initial Operator configuration {#installation-operators-config_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

After the control plane initializes, you must immediately configure some Operators so that they all become available.

**Prerequisites**

- Your control plane has initialized.

**Procedure**

1. Watch the cluster components come online:
   ```terminal
   $ watch -n5 oc get clusteroperators
   ```

   ```
2. Configure the Operators that are not available.

### Disabling the default software catalog sources {#olm-restricted-networks-operatorhub_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To use only trusted or locally available Operator catalogs, disable the default software catalog sources that OpenShift Container Platform configures during installation. In a restricted network environment, you must disable the default catalogs as a cluster administrator.

**Procedure**

- Disable the sources for the default catalogs by adding `disableAllDefaultSources: true` to the `OperatorHub` object:
  ```terminal
  $ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
      -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
  ```

  :::tip

  Or, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the **Administration** → **Cluster Settings** → **Configuration** → **OperatorHub** page, click the **Sources** tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.

  :::

### Image registry storage configuration {#installation-registry-storage-config_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

The Image Registry Operator is not initially available for platforms that do not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your registry to use storage so that the Registry Operator is made available.

Configure a persistent volume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, you can configure an empty directory as the storage location for non-production clusters.

You can also allow the image registry to use block storage types by using the `Recreate` rollout strategy during upgrades.

#### Change the image registry’s management state {#registry-change-management-state_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To start the image registry, you must change the Image Registry Operator configuration’s `managementState` from `Removed` to `Managed`.

**Procedure**

- Change `managementState` Image Registry Operator configuration from `Removed` to `Managed`. For example:
  ```terminal
  $ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"managementState":"Managed"}}'
  ```

#### Configure registry storage for IBM Power {#_configure_registry_storage_for_ibm_power_title}

As a cluster administrator, following installation you must configure your registry to use storage.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
- You have a cluster on IBM Power(R).
- You have provisioned persistent storage for your cluster, such as Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.
  :::warning

  OpenShift Container Platform supports `ReadWriteOnce` access for image registry storage when you have only one replica. `ReadWriteOnce` access also requires that the registry uses the `Recreate` rollout strategy. To deploy an image registry that supports high availability with two or more replicas, `ReadWriteMany` access is required.

  :::
- You must have a system with at least 100Gi capacity.

**Procedure**

1. To configure your registry to use storage, change the `spec.storage.pvc` in the `configs.imageregistry/cluster` resource.
   :::note

   When you use shared storage, review your security settings to prevent outside access.

   :::
2. Verify that you do not have a registry pod:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get pod -n openshift-image-registry -l docker-registry=default
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   No resources found in openshift-image-registry namespace
   ```

   :::note

   If you do have a registry pod in your output, you do not need to continue with this procedure.

   :::
3. Check the registry configuration:
   ```terminal
   $ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io
   ```

   ```yaml title="Example output"
   storage:
     pvc:
       claim:
   ```

   Leave the `claim` field blank to allow the automatic creation of an `image-registry-storage` PVC.
4. Check the `clusteroperator` status:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get clusteroperator image-registry
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME             VERSION              AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE
   image-registry   4.22                 True        False         False      6h50m
   ```
5. Ensure that your registry is set to managed to enable building and pushing of images.
   - Run:
     ```
     $ oc edit configs.imageregistry/cluster
     ```

     Then, change the line

     ```
     managementState: Removed
     ```

     to

     ```
     managementState: Managed
     ```

#### Configure storage for the image registry in non-production clusters {#installation-registry-storage-non-production_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

You must configure storage for the Image Registry Operator. For non-production clusters, you can set the image registry to an empty directory, but you lose all images if you restart the registry.

**Procedure**

- To set the image registry storage to an empty directory:
  ```terminal
  $ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
  ```

  :::warning

  Configure this option only for non-production clusters.

  :::

  If you run this command before the Image Registry Operator initializes its components, the `oc patch` command fails with the following error:

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  Error from server (NotFound): configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io "cluster" not found
  ```

  Wait a few minutes and run the command again.

## Completing installation on user-provisioned infrastructure {#installation-complete-user-infra_installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power}

To finalize the installation on user-provisioned infrastructure, complete the cluster deployment after configuring the Operators. This ensures the cluster is fully operational on the infrastructure that you provide.

**Prerequisites**

- Your control plane has initialized.
- You have completed the initial Operator configuration.

**Procedure**

1. Confirm that all the cluster components are online with the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ watch -n5 oc get clusteroperators
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME                                       VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE

   Alternatively, the following command notifies you when all of the clusters are available. The command also retrieves and displays credentials:

   ```terminal
   $ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for install-complete
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;installation_directory&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the path to the directory that you stored the installation files in.</dd>
   </dl>

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize...
   ```

   The command succeeds when the Cluster Version Operator finishes deploying the OpenShift Container Platform cluster from Kubernetes API server.

   :::warning

   - The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
   - It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

2. Confirm that the Kubernetes API server is communicating with the pods.
   1. To view a list of all pods, use the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc get pods --all-namespaces
      ```

      ```terminal title="Example output"
      NAMESPACE                         NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

      openshift-apiserver               apiserver-z25h4                                 1/1     Running     0          2m

      ```
   2. View the logs for a pod that is listed in the output of the previous command by using the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>
      ```

      where:

      <dl>
      <dt><code>&lt;namespace&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the pod name and namespace, as shown in the output of an earlier command. If the pod logs display, the Kubernetes API server can communicate with the cluster machines.</dd>
      </dl>
3. Additional steps are required to enable multipathing. Do not enable multipathing during installation.
   See "Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS" in the *Postinstallation machine configuration tasks* documentation for more information.
4. Register your cluster on the [Cluster registration](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/register) page.
