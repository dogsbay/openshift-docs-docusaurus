# Using the vSphere Problem Detector Operator {#using-vsphere-problem-detector-operator}

<a id="using-vsphere-problem-detector-operator"></a>

You can use the vSphere Problem Detector Operator to check a cluster that you deployed on VMware vSphere for common installation and configuration issues that relate to storage.

## About the vSphere Problem Detector Operator {#vsphere-problem-detector-about_vsphere-problem-detector}

The vSphere Problem Detector Operator checks a cluster that you deployed on VMware vSphere for common installation and configuration issues that relate to storage.

After the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that a cluster runs on VMware vSphere, the Cluster Storage Operator launches the vSphere Problem Detector Operator. When the vSphere Problem Detector Operator starts, the Operator immediately runs the checks. The vSphere Problem Detector Operator communicates with the vSphere vCenter Server to find the virtual machines in the cluster, the default datastore, and other information about the vSphere vCenter Server configuration. The Operator uses the credentials from the Cloud Credential Operator to connect to vSphere.

The Operator runs the checks according to the following schedule:

- The checks run every hour.
- If any check fails, the Operator runs the checks again in intervals of 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4, 8, and so on. The Operator doubles the interval up to a maximum interval of 8 hours.
- When all checks pass, the schedule returns to an hour interval.

After a failure, the Operator increases its check frequency to quickly report success when the failure condition gets resolved. You can run the Operator manually for immediate troubleshooting information.

## Running the vSphere Problem Detector Operator checks {#vsphere-problem-detector-running_vsphere-problem-detector}

You can override the schedule for running the vSphere Problem Detector Operator checks and run the checks immediately.

The vSphere Problem Detector Operator automatically runs the checks every hour. After the Operator starts, the Operator runs the checks immediately. After the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that a cluster runs on VMware vSphere, the Cluster Storage Operator starts the vSphere Problem Detector Operator. To run the checks immediately, you can scale the vSphere Problem Detector Operator to `0` and back to `1` so that the Cluster Storage Operator restarts the vSphere Problem Detector Operator.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

**Procedure**

- Scale the Operator to `0`:
  ```terminal
  $ oc scale deployment/vsphere-problem-detector-operator --replicas=0 \
      -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
  ```

**Verification**

- Verify that the pods have restarted by running the following command:
  ```terminal
  $ oc -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator get pod -l name=vsphere-problem-detector-operator -w
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  vsphere-problem-detector-operator-77486bd645-9ntpb   1/1     Running   0          11s
  ```

  The `AGE` field must indicate that the pod restarted.

- Viewing the logs from the vSphere Problem Detector Operator

## Viewing the events from the vSphere Problem Detector Operator {#vsphere-problem-detector-viewing-events_vsphere-problem-detector}

After the vSphere Problem Detector Operator runs and performs the configuration checks, the Operator creates events that you can view from the command-line interface (CLI) or from the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

**Prerequisites**

- The vSphere Problem Detector Operator ran checks on your cluster.

**Procedure**

- To view the events by using the CLI, run the following command:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get event -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator \
      --sort-by={.metadata.creationTimestamp}
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  16m     Normal    Started             pod/vsphere-problem-detector-operator-xxxxx         Started container vsphere-problem-detector
  16m     Normal    Created             pod/vsphere-problem-detector-operator-xxxxx         Created container vsphere-problem-detector
  16m     Normal    LeaderElection      configmap/vsphere-problem-detector-lock    vsphere-problem-detector-operator-xxxxx became leader
  ```
- To view the events by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to **Home** → **Events** and select `openshift-cluster-storage-operator` from the **Project** menu.

## Viewing the logs from the vSphere Problem Detector Operator {#vsphere-problem-detector-viewing-logs_vsphere-problem-detector}

After the vSphere Problem Detector Operator runs and performs the configuration checks, the Operator creates log records that you can view from the command-line interface (CLI) or from the OpenShift Container Platform web console. Log lines that indicate `passed` means that you do not need to perform any actions.

The ideal output for a log line indicates `passed` or `0 problems`. If a log line indicates `failure` or 1 or more problems, see the information in the "Configuration checks run by the vSphere Problem Detector Operator" document.

**Prerequisites**

- The vSphere Problem Detector Operator ran checks on your cluster.

**Procedure**

- To view the logs by using the CLI, run the following command. A log line that shows `passed` in the output means that you must analyze the log output and resolve the issue.
  ```terminal
  $ oc logs deployment/vsphere-problem-detector-operator \
      -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  I0108 08:32:28.445696       1 operator.go:209] ClusterInfo passed
  I0108 08:32:28.451029       1 datastore.go:57] CheckStorageClasses checked 1 storage classes, 0 problems found
  I0108 08:32:28.451047       1 operator.go:209] CheckStorageClasses passed
  I0108 08:32:28.452160       1 operator.go:209] CheckDefaultDatastore passed
  I0108 08:32:28.480648       1 operator.go:271] CheckNodeDiskUUID:<host_name> passed
  I0108 08:32:28.480685       1 operator.go:271] CheckNodeProviderID:<host_name> passed
  ```
- To view the Operator logs with the OpenShift Container Platform web console, perform the following steps:
  1. Navigate to **Workloads** → **Pods**.
  2. Select `openshift-cluster-storage-operator` from the **Projects** menu.
  3. Click the link for the `vsphere-problem-detector-operator` pod.
  4. Click the **Logs** tab on the **Pod details** page to view the logs.

## Configuration checks run by the vSphere Problem Detector Operator {#vsphere-problem-detector-config-checks_vsphere-problem-detector}

The following tables identify the configuration checks that the vSphere Problem Detector Operator runs. Some checks verify the configuration of the cluster. Other checks verify the configuration of each node in the cluster.

## About the storage class configuration check {#vsphere-problem-detector-storage-class-config-check_vsphere-problem-detector}

The datastore name and cluster ID relate to the names for persistent volumes that use VMware vSphere storage. After the creation of a persistent volume, `systemd` creates a mount unit for the persistent volume.

The `systemd` process has a 255 character limit for the length of the fully qualified path to the virtual machine disk (VMDK) file. This path follows the naming conventions for `systemd` and vSphere. The naming conventions use the following example pattern:

```text
/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume/mounts/[<datastore>] 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/<cluster_id>-dynamic-pvc-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.vmdk
```

- The naming conventions require 205 characters of the 255 character limit.
- The deployment determines the datastore name and the cluster ID.
- The datastore name and cluster ID substitute into the example pattern. The fully qualified path gets processed with the `systemd-escape` command to escape special characters. For example, after the escape operation, a hyphen character uses four characters, such as `\x2d`.
- After the `systemd-escape` CLI processes the VMDK file path, the length of the path must not be lower than 255 characters. This criteria ensures that the `systemd` process can access the fully qualified VMDK file path.
