# Viewing a network policy {#viewing-network-policy}

<a id="viewing-network-policy"></a>

As a cluster administrator, you can view a network policy for a namespace.

## Example NetworkPolicy object {#nw-networkpolicy-object_viewing-network-policy}

Reference the example `NetworkPolicy` object to understand how to configure this object.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: app
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
```

where:

`name`
: The name of the NetworkPolicy object.

`spec.podSelector`
: A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies. The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the NetworkPolicy object.

`ingress.from.podSelector`
: A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The selector matches pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.

`ingress.ports`
: A list of one or more destination ports on which to accept traffic.

## View network policies using the CLI {#nw-networkpolicy-view-cli_viewing-network-policy}

You can examine the network policies in a namespace.

:::note

If you log in with `cluster-admin` privileges, you can edit network policies in any namespace in the cluster.

:::note

If you log in with `cluster-admin` privileges, you can edit network policies in any namespace in the cluster. In the web console, you can edit policies directly in YAML or by using the **Actions** menu.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `admin` privileges.
- You are working in the namespace where the network policy exists.

**Procedure**

1. List network policies in a namespace.
   1. To view network policy objects defined in a namespace enter the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc get networkpolicy
      ```
   2. Optional: To examine a specific network policy enter the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc describe networkpolicy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
      ```

      where:

      <dl>
      <dt><code>&lt;policy_name&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the name of the network policy to inspect.</dd>
      <dt><code>&lt;namespace&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.</dd>
      </dl>

      ```terminal
      $ oc describe networkpolicy allow-same-namespace
      ```

      ```text
      Name:         allow-same-namespace
      Namespace:    ns1
      Created on:   2021-05-24 22:28:56 -0400 EDT
      Labels:       <none>
      Annotations:  <none>
      Spec:
        PodSelector:     <none> (Allowing the specific traffic to all pods in this namespace)
        Allowing ingress traffic:
          To Port: <any> (traffic allowed to all ports)
          From:
            PodSelector: <none>
        Not affecting egress traffic
        Policy Types: Ingress
      ```
