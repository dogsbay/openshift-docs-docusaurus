# Configuring multitenant isolation with network policy {#multitenant-network-policy}

<a id="multitenant-network-policy"></a>

You can configure network policies to isolate network traffic between projects in a multitenant cluster. This isolation helps prevent unauthorized communication between workloads in different namespaces.

As a cluster administrator, you can configure your network policies to provide multitenant network isolation.

:::note

Configuring network policies as described in this section provides network isolation similar to the multitenant mode of OpenShift SDN in previous versions of OpenShift Container Platform.

## Configure multitenant isolation by using network policy {#nw-networkpolicy-multitenant-isolation_multitenant-network-policy}

You can configure network policies to isolate workloads in a project from pods and services in other namespaces. This isolation helps control network traffic between projects and improves multitenant security in your cluster.

**Prerequisites**

- Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set.
- You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `admin` privileges.

**Procedure**

1. Create the following `NetworkPolicy` objects:
   1. A policy named `allow-from-openshift-ingress`.
      ```terminal
      $ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      metadata:
        name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
      spec:
        ingress:
        - from:
          - namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress: ""
        podSelector: {}
        policyTypes:
        - Ingress
      EOF
      ```

      :::note

      `policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress: ""` is the preferred namespace selector label for OVN-Kubernetes.

      :::
   2. A policy named `allow-from-openshift-monitoring`:
      ```terminal
      $ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      metadata:
        name: allow-from-openshift-monitoring
      spec:
        ingress:
        - from:
          - namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                network.openshift.io/policy-group: monitoring
        podSelector: {}
        policyTypes:
        - Ingress
      EOF
      ```
   3. A policy named `allow-same-namespace`:
      ```terminal
      $ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      metadata:
        name: allow-same-namespace
      spec:
        podSelector:
        ingress:
        - from:
          - podSelector: {}
      EOF
      ```
   4. A policy named `allow-from-kube-apiserver-operator`:
      ```terminal
      $ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      metadata:
        name: allow-from-kube-apiserver-operator
      spec:
        ingress:
        - from:
          - namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-kube-apiserver-operator
            podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: kube-apiserver-operator
        policyTypes:
        - Ingress
      EOF
      ```

2. Optional: To confirm that the network policies exist in your current project, enter the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc describe networkpolicy
   ```
