# Set up the environment for DPF {#dpf-environment-setup}

<a id="dpf-environment-setup"></a>

Before installing the NVIDIA DPF Operator, you must set up the management cluster, configure worker nodes, and install and configure the required Operators.

## Set up the management cluster {#nw-dpf-management-cluster-setup_dpf-environment-setup}

The management cluster is a standard OpenShift Container Platform 4.22 cluster installed by using the Assisted Installer. This cluster hosts the DPF Operators and the hosted control planes for managing the hosted cluster on DPUs.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the [Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create).
- You have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

**Procedure**

1. Go to the [Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console cluster creation page](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create) and create a cluster with control-plane nodes only. Select **Data center** → **Assisted Installer**.
2. Optional: Configure jumbo MTU for each control plane node.
   1. Under **Hosts' network configuration** in the Assisted Installer wizard, select **Static IP, bridges, and bonds**.
   2. Set the **Static network configurations** section per node according to the following template, using the relevant MAC address and interface name for each node:
      ```yaml
      interfaces:
        - ipv4:
            dhcp: true
            enabled: true
          mac-address: <xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx>
          mtu: 1500 # Set to 1500 for standard MTU or 9000 for jumbo frames
          name: <interface-name>
          state: up
          type: ethernet
      ```

      :::note

      - You can alternatively configure MTU allocation on the DHCP server that allocates IPs to the control plane nodes.
      - If virtual machines are used for control-plane nodes, the MTU must be set on the bridge of the hypervisor used by the VMs.
      - When using MTU 9000, ensure the switch ports that connect the cluster’s control-plane nodes are set to handle jumbo frames.

      :::
3. Select the following operators to install with the cluster:
   - **Storage** → **Logical Volume Manager Storage**
   - **Platform Operations & Lifecycle** → **MultiCluster Engine**
   - **Scheduling** → **Node Feature Discovery**
4. Click **Add hosts** to add hosts to the cluster. Only control plane nodes are required at this stage.
5. After the installation completes, download the `KUBECONFIG` file and save it as `mgmt-kubeconfig`.

**Verification**

1. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable:
   ```terminal
   $ export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/mgmt-kubeconfig"
   ```
2. Verify that all nodes are in a `Ready` state:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

## Configure worker nodes for DPU operation {#nw-dpf-worker-machineconfig_dpf-environment-setup}

You must deploy the `dpu-worker-config` Helm chart to configure worker nodes with DPUs before adding those nodes to the management cluster. The `dpu-worker-config` Helm chart creates the `MachineConfigPool`, `dpu-worker-configuration` MachineConfig, and other required resources that configure the bridge, OVS services, and IP routing on worker nodes. The `MachineConfigPool` groups DPU-equipped worker nodes so that the Machine Config Operator can apply DPU-specific configurations to them.

The MachineConfig resource performs several configuration tasks required by DPF:

- **Bridge Configuration**: Creates a `br-ex` bridge interface that enables communication between the DPU and the hosted cluster control plane running on the management cluster. This name must match the `dpuNodeOOBBridgeName` value in the `DPFOperatorConfig` resource, or DPU provisioning fails. For more information refer to [DPF Operator Prerequisites](https://networking-docs.nvidia.com/dpf/26.4.1/host-network-configuration-prerequisites).
- **OVS Service Management**: Disables OpenShift’s default OVS services on x86 worker nodes. This is required for OVN-Kubernetes DPU Host mode operation, where networking functions are offloaded to the DPU rather than running on the host CPU.
- **IP Rules Configuration**: Sets routing rules required for pod-to-host control-plane traffic.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- The Helm CLI (`helm`) is installed on your workstation.
- You have a pull secret file that includes credentials for `registry.redhat.io`. Helm reads its registry credentials from this file, which is separate from the container runtime configuration.

**Procedure**

1. Set the `OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET` environment variable to the path of your pull secret file:
   ```terminal
   $ export OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET="/root/pull-secret.txt"
   ```
2. Deploy the `dpu-worker-config` Helm chart to create the worker node MachineConfig:
   ```terminal
   $ helm upgrade --install dpu-worker-config \
       oci://registry.redhat.io/dpu-kit-for-nvidia/dpu-worker-config-chart \
       --version 4.22.0 \
       --registry-config "${OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET}" \
       --namespace dpf-hcp-provisioner-system \
       --create-namespace \
       --disable-openapi-validation
   ```

**Verification**

- Verify that the `dpu-worker-config` Helm release is deployed:
  ```terminal
  $ helm list -n dpf-hcp-provisioner-system
  ```
- Verify that the `MachineConfigPool` was created automatically:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get mcp worker-dpu
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  NAME         CONFIG                                                 UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED   MACHINECOUNT   READYMACHINECOUNT   UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE
  worker-dpu   rendered-worker-dpu-b4a44cc606c2ffcf07067d1e943a8758   True      False      False      0              0                   0                     0                      2m
  ```
- Verify that the `dpu-worker-configuration` MachineConfig is created:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get machineconfig dpu-worker-configuration
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  NAME                       GENERATEDBYCONTROLLER   IGNITIONVERSION   AGE
  dpu-worker-configuration                           3.2.0             2m
  ```

  :::note

  The Machine Config Operator automatically reboots worker nodes to apply DPU-specific configurations after nodes with the `worker-dpu` label are added to the cluster.

  :::

## Create the DPF namespace {#nw-dpf-creating-dpf-namespace_dpf-environment-setup}

You must create a dedicated namespace for the DPF Operator and its components before installing the Operator.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

- Create the `dpf-operator-system` namespace:
  ```terminal
  $ oc create namespace dpf-operator-system
  ```

**Verification**

- Verify that the namespace was created:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get namespace dpf-operator-system
  ```

## Required Operators {#nw-dpf-installing-required-operators_dpf-environment-setup}

Before you install the DPF Operator, you must install the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, MetalLB Operator, Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, and NVIDIA Maintenance Operator.

The multicluster engine Operator and the Node Feature Discovery Operator can be installed during management cluster creation by using the Assisted Installer. After installation, configure those Operators, MetalLB, GitOps, and the Cluster Network Operator as described in "Configure the required Operators".

### Install the NVIDIA Maintenance Operator {#nw-dpf-installing-maintenance-operator_dpf-environment-setup}

The NVIDIA Maintenance Operator assists in performing maintenance tasks and gracefully draining DPU worker nodes. You install this operator by using Helm.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have installed the Helm CLI (`helm`).

**Procedure**

1. Create a Helm values file named `maintenance-operator-values.yaml` with the following content:
   ```yaml
   operatorConfig:
     deploy: true
     maxParallelOperations: 60%
   operator:
     affinity:
       nodeAffinity:
         requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
           nodeSelectorTerms:
             - matchExpressions:
                 - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
                   operator: Exists
             - matchExpressions:
                 - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
                   operator: Exists
     tolerations:
       - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
         operator: Exists
         effect: NoSchedule
       - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
         operator: Exists
         effect: NoSchedule
   ```
2. Install the Operator by using Helm:
   ```terminal
   $ helm upgrade --install maintenance-operator oci://ghcr.io/mellanox/maintenance-operator-chart \
     --namespace dpf-operator-system \
     --create-namespace \
     --disable-openapi-validation \
     --version 0.3.0 \
     --values maintenance-operator-values.yaml \
     --wait
   ```

**Verification**

- Verify that the Operator pod is running:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get pods -n dpf-operator-system
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  maintenance-operator-585767f779-kps9c   1/1     Running   0          2d23h
  ```

## Configure the required Operators {#nw-dpf-configuring-required-operators_dpf-environment-setup}

After the required Operators are installed, configure Node Feature Discovery, MetalLB, GitOps, and Cluster Network Operator for the DPF environment. This procedure also verifies that the multicluster engine and hosted control planes components are ready.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have installed the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, MetalLB Operator, Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, and NVIDIA Maintenance Operator.
- You have installed the Logical Volume Manager Storage Operator, multicluster engine operator, and the Node Feature Discovery Operator. You can install them by using the Assisted Installer during cluster creation. For manual installation, see [Installing multicluster engine operator](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.17/html/install/index) and ensure that the hosted control planes component is enabled.

**Procedure**

1. Define the cluster variables used by Node Feature Discovery:
   ```terminal
   $ export CLUSTER_NAME="doca-mgmt"
   $ export BASE_DOMAIN="example.com"
   $ export HOST_CLUSTER_API="api.${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}"
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>CLUSTER_NAME</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the management cluster name.</dd>
   <dt><code>BASE_DOMAIN</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the management cluster base domain.</dd>
   <dt><code>HOST_CLUSTER_API</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the management cluster API endpoint.</dd>
   </dl>
2. Create a file named `nfd-instance.yaml` with the following `NodeFeatureDiscovery` resource definition:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: nfd.openshift.io/v1
   kind: NodeFeatureDiscovery
   metadata:
     name: nfd-instance
     namespace: openshift-nfd
   spec:
     operand:
       workerEnvs:
         - name: KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST
           value: $HOST_CLUSTER_API
         - name: KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT
           value: "6443"
     workerConfig:
       configData: |
         sources:
           pci:
             deviceClassWhitelist:
               - "0200"
               - "03"
               - "12"
               - "0207"
             deviceLabelFields:
               - "vendor"
               - "device"
               - "class"
   ```
3. Apply the file by using `envsubst` to substitute the environment variables:
   ```terminal
   $ envsubst < nfd-instance.yaml | oc apply -f -
   ```
4. Create a file named `nfd-rule.yaml` with the following `NodeFeatureRule` resource definition to detect worker nodes with DPUs and label them with a `dpu-enabled` label:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: nfd.openshift.io/v1alpha1
   kind: NodeFeatureRule
   metadata:
     name: dpu-detection-rule
     namespace: openshift-nfd
   spec:
     rules:
       - labels:
           dpu-enabled: ""
         matchFeatures:
           - feature: pci.device
             matchExpressions:
               device:
                 op: In
                 value:
                   - a2d6
                   - a2dc
               vendor:
                 op: In
                 value:
                   - 15b3
         name: DPU-detection-rule
   ```
5. Apply the file:
   ```terminal
   $ oc apply -f nfd-rule.yaml
   ```
6. Ensure that the MetalLB Operator `Subscription` schedules Operator pods on control-plane nodes. When you install the MetalLB Operator, include the following `spec.config` settings, or patch an existing `Subscription` to add them:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
   kind: Subscription
   metadata:
     name: metallb-operator
     namespace: openshift-operators
   spec:
     channel: "stable"
     name: metallb-operator
     source: redhat-operators
     sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
     installPlanApproval: Automatic
     config:
       tolerations:
       - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
         operator: "Exists"
         effect: "NoSchedule"
       affinity:
         nodeAffinity:
           requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
             nodeSelectorTerms:
             - matchExpressions:
               - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
                 operator: "Exists"
   ```
7. Create a file named `metallb-config.yaml` with the following `MetalLB` resource definition:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
   kind: MetalLB
   metadata:
     name: metallb
     namespace: openshift-operators
   spec:
     nodeSelector:
       node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: ""
     speakerTolerations:
       - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
         operator: Exists
         effect: NoSchedule
   ```
8. Apply the MetalLB resource file:
   ```terminal
   $ oc apply -f metallb-config.yaml
   ```
9. Ensure that the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps `Subscription` includes the DPF-required environment variables. When you install the Operator, set the following `spec.config.env` values, or patch an existing `Subscription` to add them so that Argo CD can manage the `dpf-operator-system` namespace:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
   kind: Subscription
   metadata:
     name: openshift-gitops-operator
     namespace: openshift-gitops-operator
   spec:
     channel: gitops-1.21
     config:
       env:
       - name: ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES
         value: "openshift-gitops,dpf-operator-system"
       - name: CONTROLLER_CLUSTER_ROLE
         value: "cluster-admin"
       - name: SERVER_CLUSTER_ROLE
         value: "cluster-admin"
     installPlanApproval: Automatic
     name: openshift-gitops-operator
     source: redhat-operators
     sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
     startingCSV: openshift-gitops-operator.v1.21.3
   ```
10. Create a file named `argocd-instance.yaml` with the following `ArgoCD` resource definition:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1
    kind: ArgoCD
    metadata:
      name: argocd
      namespace: dpf-operator-system
    spec:
      nodePlacement:
        nodeSelector:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: ""
        tolerations:
        - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
          operator: Exists
          effect: NoSchedule
        - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
          operator: Exists
          effect: NoSchedule
      server:
        route:
          enabled: true
      controller: {}
      repo: {}
      applicationSet:
        enabled: false
      resourceExclusions: |
        - apiGroups:
          - packages.operators.coreos.com
          kinds:
          - PackageManifest
      sso:
        provider: dex
        dex:
          openShiftOAuth: true
      notifications:
        enabled: false
    ```
11. Apply the Argo CD file:
    ```terminal
    $ oc apply -f argocd-instance.yaml
    ```
12. Wait for the ArgoCD Redis deployment to be ready:
    ```terminal
    $ oc wait deployment argocd-redis -n dpf-operator-system \
      --for=condition=Available --timeout=120s
    ```
13. Enable global IP forwarding on the OVN-Kubernetes configuration:
    This command enables IP packet forwarding between different networks managed by OVN-Kubernetes.

    ```terminal
    $ oc patch network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge -p \
      '{"spec":{"defaultNetwork":{"ovnKubernetesConfig":{"gatewayConfig":{"ipForwarding":"Global"}}}}}'
    ```

**Verification**

- Verify that the `MultiClusterEngine` instance is created:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get multiclusterengine mce
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  NAME   STATUS      AGE     CURRENTVERSION   DESIREDVERSION   MESSAGE
  mce    Available   4m58s   2.17.2           2.17.2           All components available
  ```
- Verify that the hosted control planes component is enabled:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get multiclusterengine mce -o jsonpath='{.spec.overrides.components[?(@.name=="hypershift")].enabled}{"\n"}'
  ```

  :::note

  If the previous command returns `false` or an empty result, hosted control planes is not enabled and DPU provisioning fails.

  To continue, you must enable the `hypershift` component on the `MultiClusterEngine` resource. In current multicluster engine Operator versions the component is named `hypershift`; earlier versions use `hypershift-preview`.

  - If the result is empty, no `hypershift` entry exists. Run the following command to add the entry and enable it:
    ```terminal
    $ oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=json \
        -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/overrides/components/-","value":{"name":"hypershift","enabled":true}}]'
    ```
  - If the result is `false`, an entry exists but is disabled. Edit the resource and set the `hypershift` component to `enabled: true`:
    ```terminal
    $ oc edit multiclusterengine mce
    ```

  :::

  :::warning

  Do not use `oc patch --type=merge` to enable the component, because a merge patch replaces the entire `components` array and removes the other components. Use the JSON `add` patch when no entry exists, or `oc edit` when an entry exists but is disabled.

  :::
- Verify that the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` instance and `NodeFeatureRule` are configured:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get nodefeaturediscovery,nodefeaturerule -n openshift-nfd
  ```
- Verify that the `MetalLB` instance was created:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get metallb -n openshift-operators
  ```
- Verify that the Argo CD pods are running:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get pods -n dpf-operator-system -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=argocd
  ```
- Verify that IP forwarding is set to `Global`:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get network.operator.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.defaultNetwork.ovnKubernetesConfig.gatewayConfig.ipForwarding}'
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  Global
  ```
