# Creating DNS records on Google Cloud Platform {#creating-dns-records-on-gcp}

<a id="creating-dns-records-on-gcp"></a>

To create DNS records on Google Cloud, use the External DNS Operator. The DNS Operator manages external name resolution for your cluster services.

:::warning

Using the External DNS Operator on a cluster with Google Cloud Workload Identity enabled is not supported. For more information about the Google Cloud Workload Identity, see [Google Cloud Workload Identity](/docs/authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-short-term-creds#cco-short-term-creds-gcp_cco-short-term-creds).

## Create DNS records on a public managed zone for Google Cloud {#nw-control-dns-records-public-managed-zone-gcp_creating-dns-records-on-gcp}

To create DNS records on Google Cloud, use the External DNS Operator. The DNS Operator manages external name resolution for your cluster services.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have administrator privileges.

**Procedure**

1. Copy the `gcp-credentials` secret in the `encoded-gcloud.json` file by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get secret gcp-credentials -n kube-system --template='{{$v := index .data "service_account.json"}}{{$v}}' | base64 -d - > decoded-gcloud.json
   ```
2. Export your Google credentials by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=decoded-gcloud.json
   ```
3. Activate your account by using the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud auth activate-service-account  <client_email as per decoded-gcloud.json> --key-file=decoded-gcloud.json
   ```
4. Set your project by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud config set project <project_id as per decoded-gcloud.json>
   ```
5. Get a list of routes by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep console
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   openshift-console          console             console-openshift-console.apps.test.gcp.example.com                       console             https   reencrypt/Redirect     None
   openshift-console          downloads           downloads-openshift-console.apps.test.gcp.example.com                     downloads           http    edge/Redirect          None
   ```
6. Get a list of managed zones, such as `qe-cvs4g-private-zone test.gcp.example.com`, by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud dns managed-zones list | grep test.gcp.example.com
   ```
7. Create a YAML file, for example, `external-dns-sample-gcp.yaml`, that defines the `ExternalDNS` object:
   ```yaml title="Example external-dns-sample-gcp.yaml file"
   apiVersion: externaldns.olm.openshift.io/v1beta1
   kind: ExternalDNS
   metadata:
     name: sample-gcp
   spec:
     domains:
       - filterType: Include
         matchType: Exact
         name: test.gcp.example.com
     provider:
       type: GCP
     source:
       openshiftRouteOptions:
         routerName: default
       type: OpenShiftRoute
   # ...
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>metadata.name</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the External DNS name.</dd>
   </dl>

`spec.domains.filterType`
: By default, all hosted zones are selected as potential targets. You can include your hosted zone.

`spec.domains.matchType`
: Specifies the domain of the target that must match the string defined by the `name` key.

`spec.domains.name`
: Specifies the exact domain of the zone you want to update. The hostname of the routes must be subdomains of the specified domain.

`spec.provider.type`
: Specifies the provider type.

`source.openshiftRouteOptions`
: Specifies options for the source of DNS records.

`openshiftRouteOptions.routerName`
: If the source type is `OpenShiftRoute`, you can pass the OpenShift Ingress Controller name. External DNS selects the canonical hostname of that router as the target while creating a CNAME record.

`type`
: Specifies the `route` resource as the source for Google Cloud DNS records.

1. Check the DNS records created for OpenShift Container Platform routes by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ gcloud dns record-sets list --zone=qe-cvs4g-private-zone | grep console
   ```
