# Uninstalling the SR-IOV Network Operator {#uninstalling-sriov-operator}

<a id="uninstalling-sriov-operator"></a>

To uninstall the SR-IOV Network Operator, you must delete any running SR-IOV workloads, uninstall the Operator, and delete the webhooks that the Operator used.

## Uninstall the SR-IOV Network Operator {#nw-sriov-operator-uninstall_uninstalling-sr-iov-operator}

You can remove the SR-IOV Network Operator from your cluster by uninstalling the Operator. This ensures that the Operator and its associated resources are deleted when you no longer need to manage SR-IOV network devices.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
- You have the SR-IOV Network Operator installed.

**Procedure**

1. Delete all SR-IOV custom resources (CRs):
   ```terminal
   $ oc delete sriovnetwork -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --all
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc delete sriovnetworknodepolicy -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --all
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc delete sriovibnetwork -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --all
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc delete sriovoperatorconfigs -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --all
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the "Deleting Operators from a cluster" section to remove the SR-IOV Network Operator from your cluster.
3. Delete the SR-IOV custom resource definitions that remain in the cluster after the SR-IOV Network Operator is uninstalled:
   ```terminal
   $ oc delete crd sriovibnetworks.sriovnetwork.openshift.io
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc delete crd sriovnetworknodepolicies.sriovnetwork.openshift.io
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc delete crd sriovnetworknodestates.sriovnetwork.openshift.io
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc delete crd sriovnetworkpoolconfigs.sriovnetwork.openshift.io
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc delete crd sriovnetworks.sriovnetwork.openshift.io
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc delete crd sriovoperatorconfigs.sriovnetwork.openshift.io
   ```
4. Delete the SR-IOV Network Operator namespace:
   ```terminal
   $ oc delete namespace openshift-sriov-network-operator
   ```
