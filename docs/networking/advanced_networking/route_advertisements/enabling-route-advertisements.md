# Enabling route advertisements

<a id="enabling-route-advertisements"></a>

To improve network reachability and failover visibility for your cluster, you can enable route advertisements for pod and egress IP addresses. This configuration requires the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin and allows your cluster to share routes with an external provider network.

As a cluster administrator, you can configure additional route advertisements for your cluster. You must use the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

## Enabling route advertisements {#nw-route-advertisements-enable_enabling-route-advertisements}

To improve network reachability and failover visibility, you can enable additional routing support for your cluster. You can enable route advertisements to manage network traffic within your environment.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You are logged in to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
- The cluster is installed on compatible infrastructure.

**Procedure**

- To enable a routing provider and additional route advertisements, enter the following command:
  ```terminal
  $ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
    -p='{
      "spec": {
        "additionalRoutingCapabilities": {
          "providers": ["FRR"]
          },
          "defaultNetwork": {
            "ovnKubernetesConfig": {
              "routeAdvertisements": "Enabled"
      }}}}'
  ```
