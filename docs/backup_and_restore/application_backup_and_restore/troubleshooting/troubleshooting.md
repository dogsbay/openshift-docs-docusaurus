# Troubleshooting

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>

Troubleshoot OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) issues by using diagnostic tools such as the OADP CLI, webhooks, `must-gather` custom resource, and other methods. This helps you identify and resolve problems with backup and restore operations.

You can troubleshoot OADP issues by using the following methods:

- Debug Velero custom resources (CRs) by using the OpenShift CLI tool.
- Debug Velero or Restic pod crashes, which are caused due to a lack of memory or CPU.
- Debug issues with Velero and admission webhooks.
- Check OADP installation issues, OADP Operator issues, backup and restore CR issues, and Restic issues.
- Use the available OADP timeouts to reduce errors, retries, or failures.
- Run the `DataProtectionTest` (DPT) custom resource to verify your backup storage bucket configuration and check the CSI snapshot readiness for persistent volume claims.
- Collect logs and CR information by using the `must-gather` tool.
- Monitor and analyze the workload performance with the help of OADP monitoring.
