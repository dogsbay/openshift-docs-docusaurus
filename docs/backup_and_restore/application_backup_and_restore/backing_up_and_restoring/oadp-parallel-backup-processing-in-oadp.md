# Parallel backup processing in OADP {#oadp-parallel-backup-processing-in-oadp_{context}}

With parallel backup processing in OpenShift API for Data Protection, you can back up several applications from different namespaces simultaneously. This concurrent processing ensures that a single large backup task does not delay the backups for other applications in your cluster.

By default, Velero processes backup resources sequentially - one resource in the `InProgress` phase at a time. Parallel backup changes this behavior to handle backups concurrently.

The following considerations apply for enabling parallel backups in OADP:

- Resource allocation: Increasing the concurrency settings requires additional CPU and memory for the Velero container. Monitor resource consumption to ensure cluster stability.
- Backup scope: Parallel processing provides the most benefit for backups that contain a large number of Kubernetes resources or many smaller volumes. Backups dominated by a few large volumes see less benefit because most time is spent waiting for asynchronous data movement to complete.
- Namespace partitioning: To keep data integrity, OADP uses namespace-level isolation when processing parallel backups. Two backups cannot run simultaneously if they share any included namespaces.
  **Parallel backup execution examples**

  | Scenario | Included namespaces | Processing behavior |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Backup A and Backup B | `namespace1` and `namespace2` | Parallel: The namespaces are isolated. |
  | Backup A and Backup B | `namespace1` and `namespace1` | Serialized: The shared namespace creates a lock. |
  | Full cluster and Backup A | All namespaces and `namespace1` | Serialized: A cluster-wide backup includes all namespaces and locks the entire cluster. |
