# Recovering from expired control plane certificates {#dr-recovering-expired-certs}

<a id="dr-recovering-expired-certs"></a>

You can restore kubelet certificates on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster by approving pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) after control plane certificates expire. Approved CSRs return nodes to a healthy state.

## Recovering from expired control plane certificates {#dr-scenario-3-recovering-expired-certs_dr-recovering-expired-certs}

You can restore kubelet certificates by manually approving pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) and, on user-provisioned installations, kubelet serving CSRs. Approved CSRs return nodes to a healthy state after control plane certificates expire.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
- You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

1. Get the list of current CSRs by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get csr
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME        AGE    SIGNERNAME                                    REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
   csr-2s94x   8m3s   kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving                 system:node:<node_name>                                                     Pending
   csr-4bd6t   8m3s   kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving                 system:node:<node_name>                                                     Pending
   csr-4hl85   13m    kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
   csr-zhhhp   3m8s   kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
   ...
   ```

   In the example output, CSRs with a `SIGNERNAME` of `kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving` are kubelet serving CSRs. You see this CSR type on user-provisioned installations. CSRs with a `SIGNERNAME` of `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet` and a `node-bootstrapper` requestor are `node-bootstrapper` CSRs that you must approve to restore kubelet certificates.
2. Review the details of a CSR to verify that it is valid by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc describe csr <csr_name>
   ```

   `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.
3. Approve each valid `node-bootstrapper` CSR by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
   ```
4. For user-provisioned installations, approve each valid kubelet serving CSR by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
   ```
