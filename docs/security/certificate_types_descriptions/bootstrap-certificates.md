# Bootstrap certificates {#cert-types-bootstrap-certificates}

<a id="cert-types-bootstrap-certificates"></a>

You should understand how bootstrap certificates enable kubelet transport layer security (TLS) bootstrapping when nodes join a cluster, including how the certificates are issued and rotated and how the certificates are managed.

## Purpose {#bootstrap-certificates-purpose_cert-types-bootstrap-certificates}

The kubelet, in OpenShift Container Platform 4 and later, uses the bootstrap certificate located in `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` to initially bootstrap. This is followed by the bootstrap initialization process and the authorization of the kubelet to create a certificate signing request (CSR).

In that process, the kubelet generates a CSR while communicating over the bootstrap channel. The controller manager signs the CSR, resulting in a certificate that the kubelet manages. For more information, see "Bootstrap initialization" and "Authorize kubelet to create a CSR" in the *Additional resources* section.

## Management {#bootstrap-certificates-management_cert-types-bootstrap-certificates}

These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.

## Expiration {#bootstrap-certificates-expiration_cert-types-bootstrap-certificates}

This bootstrap certificate is valid for 10 years.

The kubelet-managed certificate is valid for one year and rotates automatically at around the 80 percent mark of that one year.

:::note

OpenShift Lifecycle Manager (OLM) does not update the bootstrap certificate.

## Customization {#bootstrap-certificates-customization_cert-types-bootstrap-certificates}

You cannot customize the bootstrap certificates.
