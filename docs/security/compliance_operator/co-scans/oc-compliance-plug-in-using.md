# Using the oc-compliance plugin {#using-oc-compliance-plug-in}

<a id="using-oc-compliance-plug-in"></a>

Although the Compliance Operator automates many of the checks and remediations for the cluster, an administrator can use the `oc-compliance` plugin to perform the full process of bringing a cluster into compliance by interacting with the Compliance Operator API and other components.

## Install the oc-compliance plugin {#installing-oc-compliance_oc-compliance-plug-in-understanding}

You can install the `oc-compliance` plugin to simplify compliance operations from the command line.

**Procedure**

- Extract the `oc-compliance` image to get the `oc-compliance` binary:
  ```terminal
  $ podman run --rm -v ~/.local/bin:/mnt/out:Z registry.redhat.io/compliance/oc-compliance-rhel8:stable /bin/cp /usr/bin/oc-compliance /mnt/out/
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  W0611 20:35:46.486903   11354 manifest.go:440] Chose linux/amd64 manifest from the manifest list.
  ```

  You can now run `oc-compliance`.

## Fetch raw results {#fetching-raw-results_oc-compliance-plug-in-understanding}

An administrator or auditor can review the complete detailed results of a scan as created by the OpenSCAP tool. These results contain more details than what is contained in the  `ComplianceCheckResult` custom resource (CR).

When a compliance scan finishes, the results of the individual checks are listed in the resulting `ComplianceCheckResult` custom resource (CR). However, an administrator or auditor might require the complete details of the scan. The OpenSCAP tool creates an Advanced Recording Format (ARF) formatted file with the detailed results. This ARF file is too large to store in a config map or other standard Kubernetes resource, so a persistent volume (PV) is created to contain it.

**Procedure**

1. Fetch the results from the PV by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc compliance fetch-raw <object-type> <object-name> -o <output-path>
   ```

   where:

   - `<object-type>` can be either `scansettingbinding`, `compliancescan` or `compliancesuite`, depending on which of these objects the scans were launched with.
   - `<object-name>` is the name of the binding, suite, or scan object to gather the ARF file for, and `<output-path>` is the local directory to place the results.
     For example:

     ```terminal
     $ oc compliance fetch-raw scansettingbindings my-binding -o /tmp/
     ```

     ```terminal title="Example output"
     Fetching results for my-binding scans: ocp4-cis, ocp4-cis-node-worker, ocp4-cis-node-master
     Fetching raw compliance results for scan 'ocp4-cis'.......
     The raw compliance results are available in the following directory: /tmp/ocp4-cis
     Fetching raw compliance results for scan 'ocp4-cis-node-worker'...........
     The raw compliance results are available in the following directory: /tmp/ocp4-cis-node-worker
     Fetching raw compliance results for scan 'ocp4-cis-node-master'......
     The raw compliance results are available in the following directory: /tmp/ocp4-cis-node-master
     ```
2. View the list of files in the directory:
   ```terminal
   $ ls /tmp/ocp4-cis-node-master/
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   ocp4-cis-node-master-ip-10-0-128-89.ec2.internal-pod.xml.bzip2  ocp4-cis-node-master-ip-10-0-150-5.ec2.internal-pod.xml.bzip2  ocp4-cis-node-master-ip-10-0-163-32.ec2.internal-pod.xml.bzip2
   ```
3. Extract the results:
   ```terminal
   $ bunzip2 -c resultsdir/worker-scan/worker-scan-stage-459-tqkg7-compute-0-pod.xml.bzip2 > resultsdir/worker-scan/worker-scan-ip-10-0-170-231.us-east-2.compute.internal-pod.xml
   ```
4. View the extracted results:
   ```terminal
   $ ls resultsdir/worker-scan/
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   worker-scan-ip-10-0-170-231.us-east-2.compute.internal-pod.xml
   worker-scan-stage-459-tqkg7-compute-0-pod.xml.bzip2
   worker-scan-stage-459-tqkg7-compute-1-pod.xml.bzip2
   ```

## Re-running scans {#re-running-scans_oc-compliance-plug-in-understanding}

Although it is possible to run scans as scheduled jobs, you must often re-run a scan on demand, particularly after remediations are applied or when other changes to the cluster are made.

Rerunning a scan with the Compliance Operator requires the use of an annotation on the scan object. However, with the `oc-compliance` plugin you can rerun a scan with a single command.

**Procedure**

- Rerun the scans for the `ScanSettingBinding` object named `my-binding` by running the following command:
  ```terminal
  $ oc compliance rerun-now scansettingbindings my-binding
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  Rerunning scans from 'my-binding': ocp4-cis
  Re-running scan 'openshift-compliance/ocp4-cis'
  ```

## Use ScanSettingBinding custom resources {#using-scan-setting-bindings_oc-compliance-plug-in-understanding}

When using the `ScanSetting` and `ScanSettingBinding` custom resources (CRs) that the Compliance Operator provides, it is possible to run scans for multiple profiles while using a common set of scan options, such as `schedule`, `machine roles`, `tolerations`, and so on.

Although that is easier than working with multiple `ComplianceSuite` or `ComplianceScan` objects, it can confuse new users.

The `oc compliance bind` subcommand helps you create a `ScanSettingBinding` CR.

**Procedure**

1. Run:
   ```terminal
   $ oc compliance bind [--dry-run] -N <binding name> [-S <scansetting name>] <objtype/objname> [..<objtype/objname>]
   ```

   - If you omit the `-S` flag, the `default` scan setting provided by the Compliance Operator is used.
   - The object type is the Kubernetes object type, which  can be `profile` or `tailoredprofile`. More than one object can be provided.
   - The object name is the name of the Kubernetes resource, such as `.metadata.name`.
   - Add the `--dry-run` option to display the YAML file of the objects that are created.
     For example, given the following profiles and scan settings:

     ```terminal
     $ oc get profile.compliance -n openshift-compliance
     ```

     ```terminal title="Example output"

     rhcos4-stig-v2r3           3h49m   V2R3
     ```

     ```terminal
     $ oc get scansettings -n openshift-compliance
     ```

     ```terminal title="Example output"
     NAME                 AGE
     default              10m
     default-auto-apply   10m
     ```
2. To apply the `default` settings to the `ocp4-cis` and `ocp4-cis-node` profiles, run:
   ```terminal
   $ oc compliance bind -N my-binding profile/ocp4-cis profile/ocp4-cis-node
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   Creating ScanSettingBinding my-binding
   ```

   After the `ScanSettingBinding` CR is created, the bound profile begins scanning for both profiles with the related settings. Overall, this is the fastest way to begin scanning with the Compliance Operator.

## Print controls {#printing-controls_oc-compliance-plug-in-understanding}

You can view a report of the compliance standards and controls that a given profile satisfies.

Compliance standards are generally organized into a the following hierarchy:

- A benchmark is the top-level definition of a set of controls for a particular standard. For example, FedRAMP Moderate or Center for Internet Security (CIS) v.1.6.0.
- A control describes a family of requirements that must be met to be in compliance with the benchmark. For example, FedRAMP AC-01 (access control policy and procedures).
- A rule is a single check that is specific for the system being brought into compliance, and one or more of these rules map to a control.
- The Compliance Operator handles the grouping of rules into a profile for a single benchmark. It can be difficult to determine which controls that the set of rules in a profile satisfy.

**Procedure**

- The `oc compliance` `controls` subcommand provides a report of the standards and controls that a given profile satisfies:
  ```terminal
  $ oc compliance controls profile ocp4-cis-node
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  +-----------+----------+
  | FRAMEWORK | CONTROLS |
  +-----------+----------+
  | CIS-OCP   | 1.1.1    |
  +           +----------+
  |           | 1.1.10   |
  +           +----------+
  |           | 1.1.11   |
  +           +----------+
  ...
  ```

## Fetch compliance remediation details {#fetching-compliance-remediation-details_oc-compliance-plug-in-understanding}

The Compliance Operator provides remediation objects that are used to automate the changes required to make the cluster compliant. You can use the `fetch-fixes` subcommand to help you understand exactly which configuration remediations are used.

The `fetch-fixes` extracts the remediation objects from a profile, rule, or `ComplianceRemediation` object into a directory for you to inspect.

:::warning

Use caution before applying remediations directly. Some remediations might not be applicable in bulk, such as the usbguard rules in the moderate profile. In these cases, allow the Compliance Operator to apply the rules because it addresses the dependencies and ensures that the cluster remains in a good state.

:::

**Procedure**

1. View the remediations for a profile:
   ```terminal
   $ oc compliance fetch-fixes profile ocp4-cis -o /tmp
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-api-priority-flowschema-catch-all'
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-api-priority-gate-enabled'
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-audit-log-maxbackup'
   Persisted rule fix to /tmp/ocp4-api-server-audit-log-maxsize.yaml
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-audit-log-path'
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-auth-mode-no-aa'
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-auth-mode-node'
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-auth-mode-rbac'
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-basic-auth'
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-bind-address'
   No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-client-ca'
   Persisted rule fix to /tmp/ocp4-api-server-encryption-provider-cipher.yaml
   Persisted rule fix to /tmp/ocp4-api-server-encryption-provider-config.yaml
   ```

   :::note

   The `No fixes to persist` warning is expected whenever there are rules in a profile that do not have a corresponding remediation, because either the rule cannot be remediated automatically or a remediation was not provided.

   :::
2. You can view a sample of the YAML file. The `head` command will show you the first 10 lines:
   ```terminal
   $ head /tmp/ocp4-api-server-audit-log-maxsize.yaml
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
   kind: APIServer
   metadata:
     name: cluster
   spec:
     maximumFileSizeMegabytes: 100
   ```
3. View the remediation from a `ComplianceRemediation` object created after a scan:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get complianceremediations -n openshift-compliance
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME                                             STATE
   ocp4-cis-api-server-encryption-provider-cipher   NotApplied
   ocp4-cis-api-server-encryption-provider-config   NotApplied
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ oc compliance fetch-fixes complianceremediations ocp4-cis-api-server-encryption-provider-cipher -o /tmp
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   Persisted compliance remediation fix to /tmp/ocp4-cis-api-server-encryption-provider-cipher.yaml
   ```
4. You can view a sample of the YAML file. The `head` command will show you the first 10 lines:
   ```terminal
   $ head /tmp/ocp4-cis-api-server-encryption-provider-cipher.yaml
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
   kind: APIServer
   metadata:

   spec:
     encryption:
       type: aescbc
   ```

## View ComplianceCheckResult object details {#viewing-compliance-remediation-details_oc-compliance-plug-in-understanding}

When scans are finished running, `ComplianceCheckResult` objects are created for the individual scan rules. You can use the `view-result` subcommand to provide a human-readable output of the `ComplianceCheckResult` object details.

**Procedure**

- Run:
  ```terminal
  $ oc compliance view-result ocp4-cis-scheduler-no-bind-address
  ```
