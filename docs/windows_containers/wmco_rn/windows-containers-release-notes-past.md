### Bug fixes {#wmco-10-22-0-bug-fixes_windows-containers-release-notes-past}

- Before this update, if you enabled the `ClusterAPIMachineManagement` feature gate by enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, OpenShift Container Platform provisioned the `openshift-cluster-api` namespace. However, the WMCO was not adding the `windows-user-data` secret to that namespace, which is required by Cluster API compute machine sets. Because of the missing secret, CAPI-provisioned Windows machines would not bootstrap, remaining stuck in the `Pending` phase, and never joining the cluster. With this release, the OpenShift Container Platform now detects whether the `openshift-cluster-api` namespace exists and mirrors the `windows-user-data` secret into that namespace. CAPI-provisioned Windows machines successfully receive the bootstrap secret, are no longer getting stuck in `Pending` state, and join the cluster as expected.
