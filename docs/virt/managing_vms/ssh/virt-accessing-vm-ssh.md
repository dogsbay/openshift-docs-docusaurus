# SSH access for virtual machines {#virt-accessing-vm-ssh}

<a id="virt-accessing-vm-ssh"></a>

You can use SSH to securely access your virtual machines (VMs) from the command line. You can set up your SSH configuration using the `virtctl ssh` command, `virtctl port-forward` command, a service, or a secondary network.

## Access configuration considerations {#virt-access-configuration-considerations_virt-accessing-vm-ssh}

Each method for configuring access to a virtual machine (VM) has advantages and limitations, depending on the traffic load and client requirements.

:::note

Services provide excellent performance and are recommended for applications that are accessed from outside the cluster.

:::

If the internal cluster network cannot handle the traffic load, you can configure a secondary network.

`virtctl ssh` and `virtctl port-forwarding` commands
: - Simple to configure.
  - Recommended for troubleshooting VMs.
  - `virtctl port-forwarding` recommended for automated configuration of VMs with Ansible.
  - Dynamic public SSH keys can be used to provision VMs with Ansible.
  - Not recommended for high-traffic applications like Rsync or Remote Desktop Protocol because of the burden on the API server.
  - The API server must be able to handle the traffic load.
  - The clients must be able to access the API server.
  - The clients must have access credentials for the cluster.

Cluster IP service
: - The internal cluster network must be able to handle the traffic load.
  - The clients must be able to access an internal cluster IP address.

Node port service
: - The internal cluster network must be able to handle the traffic load.
  - The clients must be able to access at least one node.

Load balancer service
: - A load balancer must be configured.
  - Each node must be able to handle the traffic load of one or more load balancer services.

Secondary network
: - Excellent performance because traffic does not go through the internal cluster network.
  - Allows a flexible approach to network topology.
  - Guest operating system must be configured with appropriate security because the VM is exposed directly to the secondary network. If a VM is compromised, an intruder could gain access to the secondary network.
