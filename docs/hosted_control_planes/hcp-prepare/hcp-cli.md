# Installing the hosted control planes command-line interface {#hcp-cli}

<a id="hcp-cli"></a>

The hosted control planes command-line interface, `hcp`, is a tool that you can use to get started with hosted control planes. For Day 2 operations, such as management and configuration, use GitOps or your own automation tool.

## Installing the hosted control planes command-line interface from the terminal {#hcp-cli-terminal_hcp-cli}

You can install the hosted control planes command-line interface (CLI), `hcp`, from the terminal.

**Prerequisites**

- On an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you have installed multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator 2.5 or later. The multicluster engine Operator is automatically installed when you install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. You can also install multicluster engine Operator without Red Hat Advanced Management as an Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform software catalog.

**Procedure**

1. Get the URL to download the `hcp` binary by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get ConsoleCLIDownload hcp-cli-download -o json | jq -r ".spec"
   ```
2. Download the `hcp` binary by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ wget <hcp_cli_download_url>
   ```

   Replace `hcp_cli_download_url` with the URL that you obtained from the previous step.
3. Unpack the downloaded archive by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ tar xvzf hcp.tar.gz
   ```
4. Make the `hcp` binary file executable by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ chmod +x hcp
   ```
5. Move the `hcp` binary file to a directory in your path by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ sudo mv hcp /usr/local/bin/.
   ```

   :::note

   If you download the CLI on a Mac computer, you might see a warning about the `hcp` binary file. You need to adjust your security settings to allow the binary file to be run.

   :::

**Verification**

- Verify that you see the list of available parameters by running the following command:
  ```terminal
  $ hcp create cluster <platform> --help
  ```

  You can use the `hcp create cluster` command to create and manage hosted clusters. The supported platforms are `agent`, `aws`, and `kubevirt`. The `azure` and `openstack` platforms are also available as Technology Preview features.

## Installing the hosted control planes command-line interface by using the web console {#hcp-cli-console_hcp-cli}

You can install the hosted control planes command-line interface (CLI), `hcp`, by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

**Prerequisites**

- On an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you have installed multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator 2.5 or later. The multicluster engine Operator is automatically installed when you install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. You can also install multicluster engine Operator without Red Hat Advanced Management as an Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform software catalog.

**Procedure**

1. From the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click the **Help icon** → **Command Line Tools**.
2. Click **Download hcp CLI** for your platform.
3. Unpack the downloaded archive by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ tar xvzf hcp.tar.gz
   ```
4. Run the following command to make the binary file executable:
   ```terminal
   $ chmod +x hcp
   ```
5. Run the following command to move the binary file to a directory in your path:
   ```terminal
   $ sudo mv hcp /usr/local/bin/.
   ```

## Installing the hosted control planes command-line interface by using the content gateway {#hcp-cli-gateway_hcp-cli}

You can install the hosted control planes command-line interface (CLI), `hcp`, by using the content gateway.

**Prerequisites**

- On an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you have installed multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator 2.7 or later. The multicluster engine Operator is automatically installed when you install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. You can also install multicluster engine Operator without Red Hat Advanced Management as an Operator from OpenShift Container Platform OperatorHub.

**Procedure**

1. Navigate to the [content gateway](https://developers.redhat.com/content-gateway/rest/browse/pub/mce/clients/hcp-cli/) and download the `hcp` binary.
2. Unpack the downloaded archive by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ tar xvzf hcp.tar.gz
   ```
3. Make the `hcp` binary file executable by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ chmod +x hcp
   ```
4. Move the `hcp` binary file to a directory in your path by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ sudo mv hcp /usr/local/bin/.
   ```
