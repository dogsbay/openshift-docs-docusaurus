# Postinstallation cluster tasks {#post-install-cluster-tasks}

<a id="post-install-cluster-tasks"></a>

After installing OpenShift Container Platform, you can configure, scale, and maintain your cluster to meet operational requirements, including managing nodes and infrastructure workloads, enabling features, applying autoscaling, and maintaining etcd.

After installing OpenShift Container Platform, you can further expand and customize your cluster to your requirements.

## Available cluster customizations {#available_cluster_customizations}

You complete most of the cluster configuration and customization after you deploy your OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Several *configuration resources* are available.

:::note

If you install your cluster on IBM Z(R), not all features and functions are available.

:::

You modify the configuration resources to configure the major features of the cluster, such as the image registry, networking configuration, image build behavior, and the identity provider.

For current documentation of the settings that you control by using these resources, use the `oc explain` command, for example `oc explain builds --api-version=config.openshift.io/v1`

### Cluster configuration resources {#configuration-resources_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Review the globally scoped cluster configuration resources that control major features of an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

All cluster configuration resources are globally scoped (not namespaced) and named `cluster`.

## Adding worker nodes {#adding-worker-nodes_post-install-cluster-tasks}

After you deploy your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can add worker nodes to scale cluster resources using the method that matches your installation type and environment.

After you deploy your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can add worker nodes to scale cluster resources. There are different ways you can add worker nodes depending on the installation method and the environment of your cluster.

### Adding worker nodes to an on-premise cluster {#adding-nodes-iso_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Add worker nodes to an on-premise OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using the OpenShift CLI to generate an ISO image.

For on-premise clusters, you can add worker nodes by using the OpenShift Container Platform CLI (`oc`) to generate an ISO image, which can then be used to boot one or more nodes in your target cluster. This process can be used regardless of how you installed your cluster.

You can add one or more nodes at a time while customizing each node with more complex configurations, such as static network configuration, or you can specify only the MAC address of each node. Any configurations that are not specified during ISO generation are retrieved from the target cluster and applied to the new nodes.

Preflight validation checks are also performed when booting the ISO image to inform you of failure-causing issues before you attempt to boot each node.

### Adding worker nodes to installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters {#adding-nodes-ipi_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Add worker nodes to installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters by scaling machine sets or provisioning bare-metal hosts.

For installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you can manually or automatically scale the `MachineSet` object to match the number of available bare-metal hosts.

To add a bare-metal host, you must configure all network prerequisites, configure an associated `baremetalhost` object, then provision the worker node to the cluster. You can add a bare-metal host manually or by using the web console.

- [Manually adding a worker node to an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster](/docs/installing/installing_bare_metal/bare-metal-expanding-the-cluster#preparing-the-bare-metal-node_bare-metal-expanding)

### Adding worker nodes to user-provisioned infrastructure clusters {#adding-nodes-upi_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Add worker nodes to user-provisioned infrastructure clusters by using an ISO image and Ignition config files.

For user-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you can add worker nodes by using a RHEL or RHCOS ISO image and connecting it to your cluster using cluster Ignition config files. For RHEL worker nodes, the following example uses Ansible playbooks to add worker nodes to the cluster. For RHCOS worker nodes, the following example uses an ISO image and network booting to add worker nodes to the cluster.

**Additional resources**

- [Adding RHCOS worker nodes to a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster](/docs/post_installation_configuration/node-tasks#post-install-config-adding-fcos-compute)

### Adding worker nodes to clusters managed by the Assisted Installer {#adding-nodes-assisted_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Add worker nodes to Assisted Installer clusters by using Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager, the REST API, or a manual ISO process.

For clusters managed by the Assisted Installer, you can add worker nodes by using the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager console, the Assisted Installer REST API or you can manually add worker nodes using an ISO image and cluster Ignition config files.

- [Manually adding worker nodes to a single-node OpenShift cluster](/docs/nodes/nodes/nodes-sno-worker-nodes#sno-adding-worker-nodes-to-single-node-clusters-manually_add-workers)

### Adding worker nodes to clusters managed by the multicluster engine for Kubernetes {#adding-nodes-mce_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Add worker nodes to multicluster engine for Kubernetes clusters by using the dedicated console.

For clusters managed by the multicluster engine for Kubernetes, you can add worker nodes by using the dedicated multicluster engine console.

## Adjust worker nodes {#post-install-adjust-worker-nodes_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Resize worker nodes by creating new compute machine sets, scaling them up, and scaling down the original machine set before removal.

If you incorrectly sized the worker nodes during deployment, adjust them by creating one or more new compute machine sets, scale them up, then scale the original compute machine set down before removing them.

### Understanding the difference between compute machine sets and the machine config pool {#differences-between-machinesets-and-machineconfigpool_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Compute machine sets and machine config pools control different aspects of node lifecycle in OpenShift Container Platform. Understanding how each object relates to scaling and upgrades helps you configure nodes correctly.

`MachineSet` objects describe OpenShift Container Platform nodes with respect to the cloud or machine provider.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows `MachineConfigController` components to define and provide the status of machines in the context of upgrades.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows users to configure how upgrades are rolled out to the OpenShift Container Platform nodes in the machine config pool.

The `NodeSelector` object can be replaced with a reference to the `MachineSet` object.

### Scaling a compute machine set manually {#machineset-manually-scaling_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To add or remove an instance of a machine in a compute machine set, you can manually scale the compute machine set.

This guidance is relevant to fully automated, installer-provisioned infrastructure installations. Customized, user-provisioned infrastructure installations do not have compute machine sets.

**Prerequisites**

- Install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the `oc` command line.
- Log in to  `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

**Procedure**

1. View the compute machine sets that are in the cluster by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get machinesets.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
   ```

   The compute machine sets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.
2. View the compute machines that are in the cluster by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
   ```
3. Set the annotation on the compute machine that you want to delete by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc annotate machines.machine.openshift.io/<machine_name> -n openshift-machine-api machine.openshift.io/delete-machine="true"
   ```
4. Scale the compute machine set by running one of the following commands:
   ```terminal
   $ oc scale --replicas=2 machinesets.machine.openshift.io <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
   ```

   Or:

   ```terminal
   $ oc edit machinesets.machine.openshift.io <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
   ```

   :::tip

   You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the compute machine set:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
   kind: MachineSet
   metadata:
     name: <machineset>
     namespace: openshift-machine-api
   spec:
     replicas: 2
   ```

   :::

   You can scale the compute machine set up or down. It takes several minutes for the new machines to be available.

   :::warning

   By default, the machine controller tries to drain the node that is backed by the machine until it succeeds. In some situations, such as with a misconfigured pod disruption budget, the drain operation might not be able to succeed. If the drain operation fails, the machine controller cannot proceed removing the machine.

   You can skip draining the node by annotating `machine.openshift.io/exclude-node-draining` in a specific machine.

   :::

**Verification**

- Verify the deletion of the intended machine by running the following command:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io
  ```

### The compute machine set deletion policy {#machineset-delete-policy_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Compute machine sets can be configured to use the `Random`, `Newest`, and `Oldest` deletion options. The default is `Random`, meaning that random machines are chosen and deleted when scaling compute machine sets down.

The deletion policy can be set according to the use case by modifying the particular compute machine set as in the following example:

```yaml
spec:
  deletePolicy: <delete_policy>
  replicas: <desired_replica_count>
```

Specific machines can also be prioritized for deletion by adding the annotation `machine.openshift.io/delete-machine=true` to the machine of interest, regardless of the deletion policy.

:::warning

By default, the OpenShift Container Platform router pods are deployed on workers. Because the router is required to access some cluster resources, including the web console, do not scale the worker compute machine set to `0` unless you first relocate the router pods.

:::

:::note

Custom compute machine sets can be used for use cases requiring that services run on specific nodes and that those services are ignored by the controller when the worker compute machine sets are scaling down. This prevents service disruption.

:::

### Creating default cluster-wide node selectors {#nodes-scheduler-node-selectors-cluster_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can use default cluster-wide node selectors on pods together with labels on nodes to constrain all pods created in a cluster to specific nodes.

With cluster-wide node selectors, when you create a pod in that cluster, OpenShift Container Platform adds the default node selectors to the pod and schedules the pod on nodes with matching labels.

You configure cluster-wide node selectors by editing the Scheduler Operator custom resource (CR). You add labels to a node, a compute machine set, or a machine config. Adding the label to the compute machine set ensures that if the node or machine goes down, new nodes have the label. Labels added to a node or machine config do not persist if the node or machine goes down.

:::note

You can add additional key/value pairs to a pod. But you cannot add a different value for a default key.

:::

The following procedure adds a default cluster-wide node selector.

**Procedure**

1. Edit the Scheduler Operator CR to add the default cluster-wide node selectors:
   ```terminal
   $ oc edit scheduler cluster
   ```

   ```yaml title="Example Scheduler Operator CR with a node selector"
   apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
   kind: Scheduler
   metadata:
     name: cluster
   ...
   spec:
     defaultNodeSelector: type=user-node,region=east
     mastersSchedulable: false
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>spec.defaultNodeSelector</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a node selector with the appropriate <code>&lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;</code> pairs.</dd>
   </dl>

   After making this change, wait for the pods in the `openshift-kube-apiserver` project to redeploy. This can take several minutes. The default cluster-wide node selector does not take effect until the pods redeploy.
2. Add labels to a node by using a compute machine set or editing the node directly:
   - Use a compute machine set to add labels to nodes managed by the compute machine set when a node is created:
     1. Run the following command to add labels to a `MachineSet` object:
        ```terminal
        $ oc patch MachineSet <name> --type='json' -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/metadata/labels", "value":{"<key>"="<value>","<key>"="<value>"}}]'  -n openshift-machine-api
        ```

        Add a `<key>/<value>` pair for each label.

        For example:

        ```terminal
        $ oc patch MachineSet ci-ln-l8nry52-f76d1-hl7m7-worker-c --type='json' -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/metadata/labels", "value":{"type":"user-node","region":"east"}}]'  -n openshift-machine-api
        ```

        :::tip

        You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add labels to a compute machine set:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
        kind: MachineSet
        metadata:
          name: <machineset>
          namespace: openshift-machine-api
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              metadata:
                labels:
                  region: "east"
                  type: "user-node"
        ```

        :::
     2. Verify that the labels are added to the `MachineSet` object by using the `oc edit` command:
        For example:

        ```terminal
        $ oc edit MachineSet abc612-msrtw-worker-us-east-1c -n openshift-machine-api
        ```

        ```yaml title="Example MachineSet object"
        apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
        kind: MachineSet
          ...
        spec:
          ...
          template:
            metadata:
          ...
            spec:
              metadata:
                labels:
                  region: east
                  type: user-node
          ...
        ```
     3. Redeploy the nodes associated with that compute machine set by scaling down to `0` and scaling up the nodes:
        For example:

        ```terminal
        $ oc scale --replicas=0 MachineSet ci-ln-l8nry52-f76d1-hl7m7-worker-c -n openshift-machine-api
        ```

        ```terminal
        $ oc scale --replicas=1 MachineSet ci-ln-l8nry52-f76d1-hl7m7-worker-c -n openshift-machine-api
        ```
     4. When the nodes are ready and available, verify that the label is added to the nodes by using the `oc get` command:
        ```terminal
        $ oc get nodes -l <key>=<value>
        ```

        For example:

        ```terminal
        $ oc get nodes -l type=user-node
        ```

        ```terminal title="Example output"
        NAME                                       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
        ci-ln-l8nry52-f76d1-hl7m7-worker-c-vmqzp   Ready    worker   61s   v1.35.4
        ```
   - Add labels directly to a node:
     1. Edit the `Node` object for the node:
        ```terminal
        $ oc label nodes <name> <key>=<value>
        ```

        For example, to label a node:

        ```terminal
        $ oc label nodes ci-ln-l8nry52-f76d1-hl7m7-worker-b-tgq49 type=user-node region=east
        ```

        :::tip

        You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add labels to a node:

        ```yaml
        kind: Node
        apiVersion: v1
        metadata:
          name: <node_name>
          labels:
            type: "user-node"
            region: "east"
        ```

        :::
     2. Verify that the labels are added to the node using the `oc get` command:
        ```terminal
        $ oc get nodes -l <key>=<value>,<key>=<value>
        ```

        For example:

        ```terminal
        $ oc get nodes -l type=user-node,region=east
        ```

        ```terminal title="Example output"
        NAME                                       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
        ci-ln-l8nry52-f76d1-hl7m7-worker-b-tgq49   Ready    worker   17m   v1.35.4
        ```

## Improving cluster stability in high latency environments using worker latency profiles {#post-worker-latency-profiles_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Configure worker latency profiles to improve cluster stability in high latency environments.

If as a cluster administrator, you performed latency tests for platform verification, you might discover the need to adjust the operation of the cluster to ensure stability in cases of high latency.

As a cluster administrator, you need to change only one parameter, recorded in a file, which controls four parameters affecting how supervisory processes read status and interpret the health of the cluster. Changing only the one parameter provides cluster tuning in an easy, supportable manner.

The `Kubelet` process provides the starting point for monitoring cluster health. The `Kubelet` sets status values for all nodes in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The Kubernetes Controller Manager (`kube controller`) reads the status values every 10 seconds, by default. If the `kube controller` cannot read a node status value, it loses contact with that node after a configured period. The default behavior is:

1. The node controller on the control plane updates the node health to `Unhealthy` and marks the node `Ready` condition `Unknown`.
2. In response, the scheduler stops scheduling pods to that node.
3. The Node Lifecycle Controller adds a `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint with a `NoExecute` effect to the node and schedules any pods on the node for eviction after five minutes, by default.

This behavior can cause problems if your network is prone to latency issues, especially if you have nodes at the network edge. In some cases, the Kubernetes Controller Manager might not receive an update from a healthy node due to network latency. The `Kubelet` evicts pods from the node even though the node is healthy.

To avoid this problem, you can use *worker latency profiles* to adjust the frequency that the `Kubelet` and the Kubernetes Controller Manager wait for status updates before taking action. These adjustments help to ensure that your cluster runs properly if network latency between the control plane and the worker nodes is not optimal.

These worker latency profiles contain three sets of parameters that are predefined with carefully tuned values to control the reaction of the cluster to increased latency. There is no need to experimentally find the best values manually.

You can configure worker latency profiles when installing a cluster or at any time you notice increased latency in your cluster network.

### Understanding worker latency profiles {#nodes-cluster-worker-latency-profiles-about_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Review the following information to learn about worker latency profiles, which allow you to control the reaction of the cluster to latency issues without needing to determine the best values by using manual methods.

Worker latency profiles are four different categories of carefully-tuned parameters. The four parameters which implement these values are `node-status-update-frequency`, `node-monitor-grace-period`, `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds`.

:::warning

Setting these parameters manually is not supported. Incorrect parameter settings adversely affect cluster stability.

:::

All worker latency profiles configure the following parameters:

node-status-update-frequency
: Specifies how often the kubelet posts node status to the API server.

node-monitor-grace-period
: Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for an update from a kubelet before marking the node unhealthy and adding the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint to the node.

default-not-ready-toleration-seconds
: Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unhealthy that the Kube API Server Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.

default-unreachable-toleration-seconds
: Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unreachable that the Kube API Server Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.

The following Operators monitor the changes to the worker latency profiles and respond accordingly:

- The Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the `node-status-update-frequency` parameter on the compute nodes.
- The Kubernetes Controller Manager updates the `node-monitor-grace-period` parameter on the control plane nodes.
- The Kubernetes API Server Operator updates the `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` parameters on the control plane nodes.

Although the default configuration works in most cases, OpenShift Container Platform offers two other worker latency profiles for situations where the network is experiencing higher latency than usual. The three worker latency profiles are described in the following sections:

Default worker latency profile
: With the `Default` profile, each `Kubelet` updates its status every 10 seconds (`node-status-update-frequency`). The `Kube Controller Manager` checks the statuses of `Kubelet` every 5 seconds.

  The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits 40 seconds (`node-monitor-grace-period`) for a status update from `Kubelet` before considering the `Kubelet` unhealthy. If no status is made available to the Kubernetes Controller Manager, it then marks the node with the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint and evicts the pods on that node.

  If a pod is on a node that has the `NoExecute` taint, the pod runs according to `tolerationSeconds`. If the node has no taint, it will be evicted in 300 seconds (`default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` settings of the `Kube API Server`).

Medium worker latency profile
: Use the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile if the network latency is slightly higher than usual.

  The `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile reduces the frequency of kubelet updates to 20 seconds and changes the period that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for those updates to 2 minutes. The pod eviction period for a pod on that node is reduced to 60 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.

  The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for 2 minutes to consider a node unhealthy. In another minute, the eviction process starts.

Low worker latency profile
: Use the `LowUpdateSlowReaction` profile if the network latency is extremely high.

  The `LowUpdateSlowReaction` profile reduces the frequency of kubelet updates to 1 minute and changes the period that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for those updates to 5 minutes. The pod eviction period for a pod on that node is reduced to 60 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.

  The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for 5 minutes to consider a node unhealthy. In another minute, the eviction process starts.

The latency profiles do not support custom machine config pools, only the default worker machine config pools.

### Using and changing worker latency profiles {#nodes-cluster-worker-latency-profiles-using_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can change a worker latency profile to deal with network latency at any time by editing the `node.config` object. With this configuration, you can ensure that your cluster runs properly if network latency between the control plane and the compute nodes fluctuates.

You must move one worker latency profile at a time. For example, you cannot move directly from the `Default` profile to the `LowUpdateSlowReaction` worker latency profile. You must move from the `Default` worker latency profile to the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile and then to the `LowUpdateSlowReaction` profile. Similarly, when returning to the `Default` profile, you must move from the low profile to the medium profile first, then to `Default`.

:::note

You can also configure worker latency profiles upon installing an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

:::

**Procedure**

1. Move to the medium worker latency profile:
   1. Edit the `node.config` object:
      ```terminal
      $ oc edit nodes.config/cluster
      ```
   2. Add `spec.workerLatencyProfile: MediumUpdateAverageReaction`:
      ```yaml title="Example node.config object"
      apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
      kind: Node
      metadata:
        annotations:
          include.release.openshift.io/ibm-cloud-managed: "true"
          include.release.openshift.io/self-managed-high-availability: "true"
          include.release.openshift.io/single-node-developer: "true"
          release.openshift.io/create-only: "true"
        creationTimestamp: "2022-07-08T16:02:51Z"
        generation: 1
        name: cluster
        ownerReferences:
        - apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
          kind: ClusterVersion
          name: version
          uid: 36282574-bf9f-409e-a6cd-3032939293eb
        resourceVersion: "1865"
        uid: 0c0f7a4c-4307-4187-b591-6155695ac85b
      spec:
        workerLatencyProfile: MediumUpdateAverageReaction
      # ...
      ```

      where:

      <dl>
      <dt><code>spec.workerLatencyProfile.MediumUpdateAverageReaction</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies that the medium worker latency policy should be used.</dd>
      </dl>

      Scheduling on each compute node is disabled as the change is being applied.
2. Optional: Move to the low worker latency profile:
   1. Edit the `node.config` object:
      ```terminal
      $ oc edit nodes.config/cluster
      ```
   2. Change the `spec.workerLatencyProfile` value to `LowUpdateSlowReaction`:
      ```yaml title="Example node.config object"
      apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
      kind: Node
      metadata:
        annotations:
          include.release.openshift.io/ibm-cloud-managed: "true"
          include.release.openshift.io/self-managed-high-availability: "true"
          include.release.openshift.io/single-node-developer: "true"
          release.openshift.io/create-only: "true"
        creationTimestamp: "2022-07-08T16:02:51Z"
        generation: 1
        name: cluster
        ownerReferences:
        - apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
          kind: ClusterVersion
          name: version
          uid: 36282574-bf9f-409e-a6cd-3032939293eb
        resourceVersion: "1865"
        uid: 0c0f7a4c-4307-4187-b591-6155695ac85b
      spec:
        workerLatencyProfile: LowUpdateSlowReaction
      # ...
      ```

      where:

      <dl>
      <dt><code>spec.workerLatencyProfile.LowUpdateSlowReaction</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies that the low worker latency policy should be used.</dd>
      </dl>

      Scheduling on each compute node is disabled as the change is being applied.

**Verification**

- When all nodes return to the `Ready` condition, you can use the following command to look in the Kubernetes Controller Manager to ensure it was applied:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get KubeControllerManager -o yaml | grep -i workerlatency -A 5 -B 5
  ```

  ```terminal title="Example output"
  # ...
      - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-11T19:47:10Z"
        reason: ProfileUpdated
        status: "False"
        type: WorkerLatencyProfileProgressing
      - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-11T19:47:10Z"
        message: all static pod revision(s) have updated latency profile
        reason: ProfileUpdated
        status: "True"
        type: WorkerLatencyProfileComplete
      - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-11T19:20:11Z"
        reason: AsExpected
        status: "False"
        type: WorkerLatencyProfileDegraded
      - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-11T19:20:36Z"
        status: "False"
  # ...
  ```

  where:

  <dl>
  <dt><code>status.message: all static pod revision(s) have updated latency profile</code></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that the profile is applied and active.</dd>
  </dl>

  To change the medium profile to default or change the default to medium, edit the `node.config` object and set the `spec.workerLatencyProfile` parameter to the appropriate value.

## Managing control plane machines {#post-install-cpms-setup_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Use control plane machine sets to manage control plane machines with capabilities similar to compute machine sets.

Control plane machine sets provide management capabilities for control plane machines that are similar to what compute machine sets provide for compute machines. The availability and initial status of control plane machine sets on your cluster depend on your cloud provider and the version of OpenShift Container Platform that you installed.

**Additional resources**

- [Control plane machine sets](/docs/machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-about#cpmso-about)
- [Getting started with control plane machine sets](/docs/machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started#cpmso-getting-started)

### Adding a control plane node to your cluster {#creating-control-plane-node_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Add a control plane node to recover from a degraded state, perform deep-level debugging, or ensure stability and security of the control plane in complex bare metal scenarios.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed a healthy cluster with at least three control plane nodes.
- You have created a single control plane node that you intend to add to your cluster as a postinstalltion task.

**Procedure**

1. Retrieve pending Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) for the new control plane node by entering the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get csr | grep Pending
   ```
2. Approve all pending CSRs for the control plane node by entering the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
   ```

   :::warning

   You must approve the CSRs to complete the installation.

   :::
3. Confirm that the control plane node is in the `Ready` status by entering the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

   :::note

   On installer-provisioned infrastructure, the etcd Operator relies on the Machine API to manage the control plane and ensure etcd quorum. The Machine API then uses `Machine` CRs to represent and manage the underlying control plane nodes.

   :::
4. Create the `BareMetalHost` and `Machine` CRs and link them to the `Node` CR of the control plane node.
   1. Create the `BareMetalHost` CR with a unique `.metadata.name` value as demonstrated in the following example:
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
      kind: BareMetalHost
      metadata:
        name: node-5
        namespace: openshift-machine-api
      spec:
        automatedCleaningMode: metadata
        bootMACAddress: 00:00:00:00:00:02
        bootMode: UEFI
        customDeploy:
          method: install_coreos
        externallyProvisioned: true
        online: true
        userData:
          name: master-user-data-managed
          namespace: openshift-machine-api
      # ...
      ```
   2. Apply the `BareMetalHost` CR by entering the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc apply -f <filename>
      ```

      where `<filename>` specifies the name of the `BareMetalHost` CR.
   3. Create the `Machine` CR by using the unique `.metadata.name` value as demonstrated in the following example:
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
      kind: Machine
      metadata:
        annotations:
          machine.openshift.io/instance-state: externally provisioned
          metal3.io/BareMetalHost: openshift-machine-api/node-5
        finalizers:
        - machine.machine.openshift.io
        labels:
          machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: <cluster_name>
          machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role: master
          machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-type: master
        name: node-5
        namespace: openshift-machine-api
      spec:
        metadata: {}
        providerSpec:
          value:
            apiVersion: baremetal.cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1
            customDeploy:
              method: install_coreos
            hostSelector: {}
            image:
              checksum: ""
              url: ""
            kind: BareMetalMachineProviderSpec
            metadata:
              creationTimestamp: null
            userData:
              name: master-user-data-managed
      # ...
      ```

      where `<cluster_name>` specifies the name of the specific cluster, for example, `test-day2-1-6qv96`.
   4. Get the cluster name by running the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath='{.status.infrastructureName}{"\n"}'
      ```
   5. Apply the `Machine` CR by entering the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc apply -f <filename>
      ```

      where `<filename>` specifies the name of the `Machine` CR.
   6. Link `BareMetalHost`, `Machine`, and `Node` objects by running the `link-machine-and-node.sh` script:
      1. Copy the following `link-machine-and-node.sh` script to a local machine:
         ```text
         #!/bin/bash

         # Credit goes to
         # https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1801238.
         # This script will link Machine object
         # and Node object. This is needed
         # in order to have IP address of
         # the Node present in the status of the Machine.

         set -e

         machine="$1"
         node="$2"

         if [ -z "$machine" ] || [ -z "$node" ]; then
             echo "Usage: $0 MACHINE NODE"
             exit 1
         fi

**Verification**

1. Confirm members of etcd by executing into one of the pre-existing control plane nodes:
   1. Open a remote shell session to the control plane node by entering the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-node-0
      ```
   2. List etcd members:
      ```terminal
      # etcdctl member list -w table
      ```
2. Check the etcd Operator configuration process until completion by entering the following command. Expected output shows `False` under the `PROGRESSING` column.
   ```terminal
   $ oc get clusteroperator etcd
   ```
3. Confirm etcd health by running the following commands:
   1. Open a remote shell session to the control plane node:
      ```terminal
      $ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-node-0
      ```
   2. Check endpoint health. Expected output shows `is healthy` for the endpoint.
      ```terminal
      # etcdctl endpoint health
      ```
4. Verify that all nodes are ready by entering the following command. The expected output shows the `Ready` status beside each node entry.
   ```terminal
   $ oc get nodes
   ```
5. Verify that the cluster Operators are all available by entering the following command. Expected output lists each Operator and shows the available status as `True` beside each listed Operator.
   ```terminal
   $ oc get ClusterOperators
   ```
6. Verify that the cluster version is correct by entering the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get ClusterVersion
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"

## Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments {#post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets-production_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Create infrastructure machine sets to host cluster infrastructure components without counting those machines toward subscription limits.

You can create a compute machine set to create machines that host only infrastructure components, such as the default router, the integrated container image registry, and components for cluster metrics and monitoring. These infrastructure machines are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment.

For information on infrastructure nodes and which components can run on infrastructure nodes, see "Creating infrastructure machine sets".

To create an infrastructure node, see "Use a machine set to create an infrastructure node", "Assign a label to infrastructure nodes", or "Use a machine config pool for infrastructure nodes".

For sample machine sets that you can use with these procedures, see "Creating machine sets for different clouds".

Applying a specific node selector to all infrastructure components causes OpenShift Container Platform to schedule those workloads on nodes with that label; see "Schedule infrastructure workloads using node selectors".

### Create a compute machine set {#machineset-creating_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To dynamically manage machine compute resources, you can create your own compute machine sets in addition to the compute machine sets created by the installation program. Use the OpenShift Container Platform CLI to automate node provisioning.

**Prerequisites**

- Deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
- Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- Log in to `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

**Procedure**

1. Create a new YAML file that contains the compute machine set custom resource (CR) sample and is named `<file_name>.yaml`.
   Ensure that you set the `<clusterID>` and `<role>` parameter values.
2. Optional: If you are not sure which value to set for a specific field, you can check an existing compute machine set from your cluster.
   1. To list the compute machine sets in your cluster, run the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
      ```

      The following is example output:

      ```terminal

      ```
   2. To view values of a specific compute machine set custom resource (CR), run the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc get machineset <machineset_name> \

      :::note

      For clusters that have user-provisioned infrastructure, a compute machine set can only create `worker` and `infra` type machines.

3. Create a `MachineSet` CR by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
   ```

  ```

  When the new compute machine set is available, the `DESIRED` and `CURRENT` values match. If the compute machine set is not available, wait a few minutes and run the command again.

### Create an infrastructure node {#creating-an-infra-node_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To reduce subscription costs, you can use labels to configure compute nodes as infrastructure nodes, where you can move infrastructure resources.

After you create the infrastructure nodes, you can move appropriate workloads to those nodes by using taints and tolerations.

You can optionally create a default cluster-wide node selector. The default node selector is applied to pods created in all namespaces and creates an intersection with any existing node selectors on a pod, which additionally constrains the pod’s selector.

:::warning

- See "Creating infrastructure machine sets" for installer-provisioned infrastructure environments or for any cluster where the control plane nodes are managed by the Machine API.
- If the default node selector key conflicts with the key of a pod’s label, then the default node selector is not applied.
  However, do not set a default node selector that might cause a pod to become unschedulable. For example, setting the default node selector to a specific node role, such as `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=""`, when a pod’s label is set to a different node role, such as `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""`, can cause the pod to become unschedulable. For this reason, use caution when setting the default node selector to specific node roles.

  You can alternatively use a project node selector to avoid cluster-wide node selector key conflicts.

:::

**Procedure**

1. Add a label to the compute nodes that you want to act as infrastructure nodes by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=""
   ```
2. Check to see if applicable nodes now have the `infra` role by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get nodes
   ```
3. Optional: Create a default cluster-wide node selector.
   1. Edit the `Scheduler` object by running the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc edit scheduler cluster
      ```
   2. Add the `defaultNodeSelector` field with the appropriate node selector by running the following command:
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
      kind: Scheduler
      metadata:
        name: cluster
      spec:
        defaultNodeSelector: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=""
      # ...
      ```

      This example node selector deploys pods on infrastructure nodes by default.
   3. Save the file to apply the changes.
      You can now move infrastructure resources to the new infrastructure nodes and remove any workloads that you do not want, or that do not belong, on the new infrastructure node. See the list of workloads supported for use on infrastructure nodes in "OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure components".

### Create a machine config pool for infrastructure machines {#creating-infra-machines_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can create a machine configuration pool for infrastructure machines to apply dedicated configuration to infra machines. You might want to apply dedicated configuration to infra machines because they run distinct workloads from other nodes in the cluster.

:::warning

Creating a custom machine configuration pool overrides default worker pool configurations if they refer to the same file or unit.

:::

**Procedure**

1. Add a label to the node you want to assign as the infra node by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc label node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;node_name&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the name of the node you want to assign as an infra node.</dd>
   </dl>
2. Create a YAML file that defines the machine config pool, as in the following example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
   kind: MachineConfigPool
   metadata:
     name: infra
   spec:
     machineConfigSelector:
       matchExpressions:
         - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker,infra]}
     nodeSelector:
       matchLabels:
         node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
   ```

   - Add the worker role and your custom role in the `spec.machineConfigSelector.matchExpressions[]` field.
   - Add the label you added to the node in the `spec.nodeSelector.matchLabels` field.
     :::note

     Custom machine config pools inherit machine configs from the worker pool. Custom pools use any machine config targeted for the worker pool, but add the ability to also deploy changes that are targeted at only the custom pool. Because a custom pool inherits resources from the worker pool, any change to the worker pool also affects the custom pool.

     :::
3. After you have the YAML file, you can create the machine config pool by specifying the file you created in the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc create -f <filename>
   ```
4. Check the machine configs to ensure that the infrastructure configuration rendered successfully by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get machineconfig
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME                                                        GENERATEDBYCONTROLLER                      IGNITIONVERSION   CREATED

   00-worker                                                   365c1cfd14de5b0e3b85e0fc815b0060f36ab955   3.5.0             31d

   ```

   You should see a new machine config, with the `rendered-infra-*` prefix.
5. Optional: To deploy changes to a custom pool, create a machine config that uses the custom pool name as the label, such as `infra`. Note that this is not required and only shown for instructional purposes. In this manner, you can apply any custom configurations specific to only your infra nodes.
   :::note

   After you create the new machine config pool, the MCO generates a new rendered config for that pool, and associated nodes of that pool reboot to apply the new configuration.

   :::

   1. Create a YAML file that defines the machine config pool, as in the following example:
      ```terminal
      $ cat infra.mc.yaml
      ```

      ```yaml title="Example output"
      apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
      kind: MachineConfig
      metadata:
        name: 51-infra
        labels:
          machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: <role>
      spec:
        config:
          ignition:
            version: 3.5.0
          storage:
            files:
            - path: /etc/infratest
              mode: 0644
              contents:
                source: data:,infra
      ```

      where:

      <dl>
      <dt><code>role</code></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the label you added to the node as a <code>nodeSelector</code>.</dd>
      </dl>
   2. Apply the machine config to the infra-labeled nodes by running the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc create -f infra.mc.yaml
      ```
6. Confirm that your new machine config pool is available by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get mcp
   ```

   ```terminal title="Example output"
   NAME     CONFIG                                             UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED   MACHINECOUNT   READYMACHINECOUNT   UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE

   worker   rendered-worker-60e35c2e99f42d976e084fa94da4d0fc   True      False      False      2              2                   2                     0                      91m
   ```

   In this example, the role of the node was changes from `worker` to `infra`.

## Assigning machine set resources to infrastructure nodes {#assigning-machine-set-resources-to-infra-nodes_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Apply taints and tolerations to infrastructure nodes so user workloads are not scheduled inadvertently to those nodes.

After creating an infrastructure machine set, the `worker` and `infra` roles are applied to new infra nodes. Nodes with the `infra` role are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment, even when the `worker` role is also applied.

However, when an infra node is assigned the worker role, there is a chance that user workloads can get assigned inadvertently to the infra node. To avoid this, you can apply a taint to the infra node and tolerations for the pods that you want to control.

### Bind infrastructure node workloads using taints and tolerations {#binding-infra-node-workloads-using-taints-tolerations_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To avoid user workloads being inadvertently assigned to an infra node, you can apply a taint to the infra node and tolerations for the pods you want to control. After creating an infrastructure machine set, the `worker` and `infra` roles are applied to new infra nodes.

Nodes with the `infra` role applied are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment, even when the `worker` role is also applied. If you have an infrastructure node that has the `infra` and `worker` roles assigned, you must configure the node so that user workloads are not assigned to it.

:::warning

It is recommended that you preserve the dual `infra,worker` label that is created for infrastructure nodes and use taints and tolerations to manage nodes that user workloads are scheduled on. If you remove the `worker` label from the node, you must create a custom pool to manage it. A node with a label other than `master` or `worker` is not recognized by the MCO without a custom pool. Maintaining the `worker` label allows the node to be managed by the default worker machine config pool, if no custom pools that select the custom label exists. The `infra` label communicates to the cluster that it does not count toward the total number of subscriptions.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- Configure additional `MachineSet` objects in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

**Procedure**

1. Add a taint to the infrastructure node to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:
   1. Determine if the node has the taint by running the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc describe nodes <node_name>
      ```

      ```text title="Sample output"
      oc describe node ci-ln-iyhx092-f76d1-nvdfm-worker-b-wln2l
      Name:               ci-ln-iyhx092-f76d1-nvdfm-worker-b-wln2l
      Roles:              worker
       ...
      Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=reserved:NoSchedule
       ...
      ```

      This example shows that the node has a taint. You can proceed with adding a toleration to your pod in the next step.
   2. If you have not configured a taint to prevent scheduling user workloads on it, configure a taint by running the following command:
      ```terminal
      $ oc adm taint nodes <node_name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
      ```

      For example:

      ```terminal
      $ oc adm taint nodes node1 node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=reserved:NoSchedule
      ```

      :::tip

      You can alternatively edit the pod specification to add the taint:

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Node
      metadata:
        name: node1
      # ...
      spec:
        taints:
          - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
            value: reserved
            effect: NoSchedule
      # ...
      ```

      :::

      These examples place a taint on `node1` that has the `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` key and the `NoSchedule` taint effect. Nodes with the `NoSchedule` effect schedule only pods that tolerate the taint, but allow existing pods to remain scheduled on the node. If you added a `NoSchedule` taint to the infrastructure node, any pods that are controlled by a daemon set on that node are marked as `misscheduled`. You must either delete the pods or add a toleration to the pods as shown in the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution [add toleration on `misscheduled` DNS pods](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6592171). Note that you cannot add a toleration to a daemon set object that is managed by an operator.

      :::note

      If a descheduler is used, pods violating node taints could be evicted from the cluster.

      :::
2. Add tolerations to the pods that you want to schedule on the infrastructure node, such as the router, registry, and monitoring workloads. Referencing the previous examples, add the following tolerations to the `Pod` object specification:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     annotations:

   # ...
   spec:
   # ...

3. Schedule the pod to the infrastructure node by using a scheduler. See the documentation for "Controlling pod placement using the scheduler" for details.
4. Remove any workloads that you do not want, or that do not belong, on the new infrastructure node. See the list of workloads supported for use on infrastructure nodes in "OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure components".

## Moving resources to infrastructure machine sets {#moving-resources-to-infrastructure-machinesets_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Move default infrastructure resources to the infrastructure machine sets that you created.

Some of the infrastructure resources are deployed in your cluster by default. You can move them to the infrastructure machine sets that you created.

### Move the router {#infrastructure-moving-router_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Deploying the router pod on an infrastructure node can reduce your OpenShift Container Platform subscription size. Move the router pod by editing the `IngressController` object in the `openshift-ingress-operator` namespace. By default, the pod is deployed to a worker node.

**Prerequisites**

- Configure additional compute machine sets in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

**Procedure**

1. View the `IngressController` custom resource for the router Operator by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get ingresscontroller default -n openshift-ingress-operator -o yaml
   ```

   ```yaml title="Example output"
   apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
   kind: IngressController
   metadata:
     creationTimestamp: 2019-04-18T12:35:39Z
     finalizers:
     - ingresscontroller.operator.openshift.io/finalizer-ingresscontroller
     generation: 1
     name: default
     namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
     resourceVersion: "11341"
     selfLink: /apis/operator.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/openshift-ingress-operator/ingresscontrollers/default
     uid: 79509e05-61d6-11e9-bc55-02ce4781844a
   spec: {}
   status:
     availableReplicas: 2
     conditions:
     - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-18T12:36:15Z
       status: "True"
       type: Available
     domain: apps.<cluster>.example.com
     endpointPublishingStrategy:
       type: LoadBalancerService
     selector: ingresscontroller.operator.openshift.io/deployment-ingresscontroller=default
   ```
2. Edit the `ingresscontroller` resource and change the `nodeSelector` to use the `infra` label by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc edit ingresscontroller default -n openshift-ingress-operator
   ```

   ```yaml title="Example output"
   apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
   kind: IngressController
   metadata:
     creationTimestamp: "2025-03-26T21:15:43Z"
     finalizers:
     - ingresscontroller.operator.openshift.io/finalizer-ingresscontroller
     generation: 1
     name: default
   # ...
   spec:
     nodePlacement:
       nodeSelector:
         matchLabels:
           node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
       tolerations:
       - effect: NoSchedule
         key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
         value: reserved
   # ...
   ```

   Add a `nodeSelector` parameter with the appropriate value to the component you want to move. You can use a `nodeSelector` parameter in the format shown or use `<key>: <value>` pairs, based on the value specified for the node. If you added a taint to the infrastructure node, also add a matching toleration.

**Verification**

- Confirm that the router pod is running on the `infra` node.
  1. View the list of router pods and note the node name of the running pod by running the following command:
     ```terminal
     $ oc get pod -n openshift-ingress -o wide
     ```

     ```terminal title="Example output"
     NAME                              READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE                           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
     router-default-86798b4b5d-bdlvd   1/1      Running       0          28s       10.130.2.4   ip-10-0-217-226.ec2.internal   <none>           <none>
     router-default-955d875f4-255g8    0/1      Terminating   0          19h       10.129.2.4   ip-10-0-148-172.ec2.internal   <none>           <none>
     ```

     In this example, the running pod is on the `ip-10-0-217-226.ec2.internal` node.
  2. View the node status of the running pod by running the following command:
     ```terminal
     $ oc get node <node_name>
     ```

     Specify the `<node_name>` that you obtained from the pod list.

     ```terminal title="Example output"
     NAME                          STATUS  ROLES         AGE   VERSION
     ip-10-0-217-226.ec2.internal  Ready   infra,worker  17h   v1.35.4
     ```

     Because the role list includes `infra`, the pod is running on the correct node.

### Move the default registry {#infrastructure-moving-registry_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Deploying the registry pod on an infrastructure node can reduce your OpenShift Container Platform subscription size. Move the registry pod by editing the `configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster` config object.

**Prerequisites**

- Configure additional compute machine sets in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

**Procedure**

1. Edit the `configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster` object by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster
   ```
2. Add a `nodeSelector` parameter with the appropriate value to the component you want to move, as shown in the following example.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/v1
   kind: Config
   metadata:
     name: cluster
   # ...
   spec:
     logLevel: Normal
     managementState: Managed
     nodeSelector:
       node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
     tolerations:
     - effect: NoSchedule
       key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
       value: reserved
   ```

   You can use a `nodeSelector` parameter in the format shown or use `<key>: <value>` pairs, based on the value specified for the node. If you added a taint to the infrastructure node, also add a matching toleration.

**Verification**

- Verify the registry pod has been moved to the infrastructure node.
  1. Identify the node where the registry pod is located by running the following command:
     ```terminal
     $ oc get pods -o wide -n openshift-image-registry
     ```
  2. Confirm the node has the label you specified:
     ```terminal
     $ oc describe node <node_name>
     ```

     where:

     <dl>
     <dt><code>&lt;node_name&gt;</code></dt>
     <dd>Specifies the name of the node that you modified. Review the command output and confirm that <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/infra</code> is in the <code>LABELS</code> list.</dd>
     </dl>

### Move the monitoring solution {#infrastructure-moving-monitoring_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Redeploy the monitoring stack to infrastructure nodes to reduce your subscription requirements. Create and apply a custom config map to move the monitoring stack to infrastructure nodes. The monitoring stack includes Prometheus, Thanos Querier, and Alertmanager, and is managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO).

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
- You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

1. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map and change the `nodeSelector` to use the `infra` label by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config -n openshift-monitoring
   ```

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:

         - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
           value: reserved
           effect: NoSchedule
   ```

   Add a `nodeSelector` parameter with the appropriate value to the component you want to move. You can use a `nodeSelector` parameter in the format shown or use `<key>: <value>` pairs, based on the value specified for the node. If you added a taint to the infrastructure node, also add a matching toleration.
2. Watch the monitoring pods move to the new machines by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ watch 'oc get pod -n openshift-monitoring -o wide'
   ```
3. If a component has not moved to the `infra` node, delete the pod with this component by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc delete pod -n openshift-monitoring <pod>
   ```

   The component from the deleted pod is re-created on the `infra` node.

## The cluster autoscaler {#cluster-autoscaler-about_post-install-cluster-tasks}

The cluster autoscaler adjusts the size of an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to meet its current deployment needs. It uses declarative, Kubernetes-style arguments to provide infrastructure management that does not rely on objects of a specific cloud provider.

The cluster autoscaler increases the size of the cluster when there are pods that fail to schedule on any of the current worker nodes due to insufficient resources or when another node is necessary to meet deployment needs. The cluster autoscaler does not increase the cluster resources beyond the limits that you specify.

The cluster autoscaler computes the total memory, CPU, and GPU on all nodes the cluster, even though it does not manage the control plane nodes. These values are not single-machine oriented. They are an aggregation of all the resources in the entire cluster. For example, if you set the maximum memory resource limit, the cluster autoscaler includes all the nodes in the cluster when calculating the current memory usage. That calculation is then used to determine if the cluster autoscaler has the capacity to add more worker resources.

:::warning

Ensure that the `maxNodesTotal` value in the `ClusterAutoscaler` custom resource (CR) that you create is large enough to account for the total possible number of machines in your cluster. This value must encompass the number of control plane machines and the possible number of compute machines that you might scale to.

:::

### Automatic node removal {#cluster-autoscaler-scale-down_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Every 10 seconds, the cluster autoscaler checks which nodes are unnecessary in the cluster and removes them. The cluster autoscaler considers a node for removal if the following conditions apply:

- The node utilization is less than the *node utilization level* threshold for the cluster. The node utilization level is the sum of the requested resources divided by the allocated resources for the node. If you do not specify a value in the `ClusterAutoscaler` custom resource, the cluster autoscaler uses a default value of `0.5`, which corresponds to 50% utilization.
- The cluster autoscaler can move all pods running on the node to the other nodes. The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on the nodes.
- The cluster autoscaler does not have scale down disabled annotation.

If the following types of pods are present on a node, the cluster autoscaler will not remove the node:

- Pods with restrictive pod disruption budgets (PDBs).
- Kube-system pods that do not run on the node by default.
- Kube-system pods that do not have a PDB or have a PDB that is too restrictive.
- Pods that are not backed by a controller object such as a deployment, replica set, or stateful set.
- Pods with local storage.
- Pods that cannot be moved elsewhere because of a lack of resources, incompatible node selectors or affinity, matching anti-affinity, and so on.
- Unless they also have a `"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict": "true"` annotation, pods that have a `"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict": "false"` annotation.

For example, you set the maximum CPU limit to 64 cores and configure the cluster autoscaler to only create machines that have 8 cores each. If your cluster starts with 30 cores, the cluster autoscaler can add up to 4 more nodes with 32 cores, for a total of 62.

:::note

By default, when the cluster autoscaler removes a node, it does not cordon the node when draining the pods from the node. You can configure the cluster autoscaler to cordon the node before draining and moving the pods by setting the `spec.scaleDown.cordonNodeBeforeTerminating` parameter to `enabled` in the `ClusterAutoscaler` CR. This parameter is disabled by default. It is recommended to enable this parameter in production clusters because of the risk of data loss, application errors, pods getting stuck in the terminating state, or other issues if the cluster autoscaler removes a node when the parameter is disabled. Leaving this parameter disabled, which can result in faster node removal, might be appropriate in clusters that run only stateless workloads.

:::

### Limitations {#cluster-autoscaler-limitations_post-install-cluster-tasks}

If you configure the cluster autoscaler, additional usage restrictions apply:

- Do not change the nodes that are in autoscaled node groups directly. All nodes within the same node group have the same capacity and labels and run the same system pods.
- Specify requests for your pods.
- If you have to prevent pods from being deleted too quickly, configure appropriate PDBs.
- Confirm that your cloud provider quota is large enough to support the maximum node pools that you configure.
- Do not run additional node group autoscalers, especially the ones offered by your cloud provider.

:::note

The cluster autoscaler only adds nodes in autoscaled node groups if doing so would result in a schedulable pod. If the available node types cannot meet the requirements for a pod request, or if the node groups that could meet these requirements are at their maximum size, the cluster autoscaler cannot scale up.

:::

### Interaction with other scheduling features {#cluster-autoscaler-interaction_post-install-cluster-tasks}

The horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) and the cluster autoscaler change cluster resources in different ways. The HPA changes the deployment’s or replica set’s number of replicas based on the current CPU load. If the load increases, the HPA creates new replicas, regardless of the amount of resources available to the cluster. If there are not enough resources, the cluster autoscaler adds resources so that the HPA-created pods can run. If the load decreases, the HPA stops some replicas. If this action causes some nodes to be underutilized or completely empty, the cluster autoscaler deletes the unnecessary nodes.

The cluster autoscaler takes pod priorities into account. The Pod Priority and Preemption feature enables scheduling pods based on priorities if the cluster does not have enough resources, but the cluster autoscaler ensures that the cluster has resources to run all pods. To honor the intention of both features, the cluster autoscaler includes a priority cutoff function. You can use this cutoff to schedule "best-effort" pods, which do not cause the cluster autoscaler to increase resources but instead run only when spare resources are available.

Pods with priority lower than the cutoff value do not cause the cluster to scale up or prevent the cluster from scaling down. No new nodes are added to run the pods, and nodes running these pods might be deleted to free resources.

### Cluster autoscaler resource definition {#cluster-autoscaler-cr_post-install-cluster-tasks}

This `ClusterAutoscaler` resource definition shows the parameters and sample values for the cluster autoscaler.

:::note

When you change the configuration of an existing cluster autoscaler, it restarts.

:::note

When performing a scaling operation, the cluster autoscaler remains within the ranges set in the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource definition, such as the minimum and maximum number of cores to deploy or the amount of memory in the cluster. However, the cluster autoscaler does not correct the current values in your cluster to be within those ranges.

The minimum and maximum CPUs, memory, and GPU values are determined by calculating those resources on all nodes in the cluster, even if the cluster autoscaler does not manage the nodes. For example, the control plane nodes are considered in the total memory in the cluster, even though the cluster autoscaler does not manage the control plane nodes.

:::

### Deploy a cluster autoscaler {#ClusterAutoscaler-deploying_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To deploy a cluster autoscaler, you create an instance of the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource.

**Procedure**

1. Create a YAML file for a `ClusterAutoscaler` resource that contains the custom resource definition.
2. Create the custom resource in the cluster by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>&lt;filename&gt;</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the name of the YAML file you created.</dd>
   </dl>

## Applying autoscaling to your cluster {#custer-tasks-applying-autoscaling_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Deploy a cluster autoscaler and machine autoscalers to apply autoscaling across machine types in your cluster.

Applying autoscaling to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster involves deploying a cluster autoscaler and then deploying machine autoscalers for each machine type in your cluster.

## Enabling Technology Preview features using FeatureGates {#post-install-tp-tasks_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Enable Technology Preview features cluster-wide by editing the `FeatureGate` custom resource.

You can turn on a subset of the current Technology Preview features on for all nodes in the cluster by editing the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR).

### Understanding feature gates {#nodes-cluster-enabling-features-about_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can use the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) to enable specific feature sets so that you can use specific non-default features in your cluster.

A feature set is a collection of OpenShift Container Platform features that are not enabled by default.

You can activate the following feature set by using the `FeatureGate` CR:

- `TechPreviewNoUpgrade`. This feature set is a subset of the current Technology Preview features. This feature set allows you to enable these Technology Preview features on test clusters, where you can fully test them, while leaving the features disabled on production clusters.
  :::warning

  Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. You should not enable this feature set on production clusters.

### Enabling feature sets using the web console {#nodes-cluster-enabling-features-console_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to enable feature sets for all of the nodes in a cluster by editing the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR). Completing this task enables non-default features in your cluster.

**Procedure**

1. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, switch to the **Administration** → **Custom Resource Definitions** page.
2. On the **Custom Resource Definitions** page, click **FeatureGate**.
3. On the **Custom Resource Definition Details** page, click the **Instances** tab.
4. Click the **cluster** feature gate, then click the **YAML** tab.
5. Edit the **cluster** instance to add specific feature sets:
   :::warning

   Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. You should not enable this feature set on production clusters.

   :::

   ```yaml title="Sample Feature Gate custom resource"
   apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
   kind: FeatureGate
   metadata:
     name: cluster (1)
   # ...
   spec:
     featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade (2)
   ```

   where:

   **`metadata.name`**

   Specifies the name of the `FeatureGate` CR. You must specify `cluster` for the name.

   **`spec.featureSet`**

   Specifies the feature set that you want to enable:

   - `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` enables specific Technology Preview features.

   After you save the changes, new machine configs are created, the machine config pools are updated, and scheduling on each node is disabled while the change is being applied.

**Verification**

You can verify that the feature gates are enabled by looking at the `kubelet.conf` file on a node after the nodes return to the ready state.

1. From the **Administrator** perspective in the web console, navigate to **Compute** → **Nodes**.
2. Select a node.
3. In the **Node details** page, click **Terminal**.
4. In the terminal window, change your root directory to `/host`:
   ```terminal
   sh-4.2# chroot /host
   ```
5. View the `kubelet.conf` file:

   # ...
   ```

   The features that are listed as `true` are enabled on your cluster.

   :::note

   The features listed vary depending upon the OpenShift Container Platform version.

   :::

### Enabling feature sets using the CLI {#nodes-cluster-enabling-features-cli_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to enable feature sets for all of the nodes in a cluster by editing the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR). Completing this task enables non-default features in your cluster.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

- Edit the `FeatureGate` CR named `cluster`:
  ```terminal
  $ oc edit featuregate cluster
  ```

  :::warning

  Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. You should not enable this feature set on production clusters.

## etcd tasks {#post-install-etcd-tasks_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Back up etcd, enable or disable etcd encryption, or defragment etcd data.

:::note

If you deployed a bare-metal cluster, you can scale the cluster up to 5 nodes as part of your post-installation tasks.

:::

**Additional resources**

- [Node scaling for etcd](/docs/etcd/etcd-performance#etcd-node-scaling_etcd-performance)

### etcd encryption {#about-etcd_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can encrypt sensitive resource data in etcd to provide an additional layer of protection if an etcd backup or storage data is exposed.

By default, etcd data is not encrypted in OpenShift Container Platform. You can enable etcd encryption for your cluster to provide an additional layer of data security. For example, it can help protect the loss of sensitive data if an etcd backup is exposed to the incorrect parties.

When you enable etcd encryption, the following OpenShift API server and Kubernetes API server resources are encrypted:

- Secrets
- Config maps
- Routes
- OAuth access tokens
- OAuth authorize tokens

When you enable etcd encryption, encryption keys are created. You must have these keys to restore from an etcd backup.

:::note

etcd encryption only encrypts values, not keys. Resource types, namespaces, and object names are unencrypted.

If etcd encryption is enabled during a backup, the `__static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz__` file contains the encryption keys for the etcd snapshot. For security reasons, store this file separately from the etcd snapshot. However, this file is required to restore a previous state of etcd from the respective etcd snapshot.

:::

### Supported encryption types {#etcd-encryption-types_post-install-cluster-tasks}

OpenShift Container Platform supports AES-CBC and AES-GCM encryption types to protect etcd data at rest.

The following encryption types are supported for encrypting etcd data in OpenShift Container Platform:

AES-CBC
: Uses AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding and a 32-byte key to perform the encryption.

AES-GCM
: Uses AES-GCM with a random nonce and a 32-byte key to perform the encryption.

The etcd encryption keys are rotated every 7 days. Up to 10 historical encryption keys are preserved after rotation to help decrypt older backups and provide an extra layer of data recovery safety.

### Enabling etcd encryption {#enabling-etcd-encryption_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Enable etcd encryption to protect sensitive cluster resources such as secrets, config maps, routes, and OAuth tokens at rest.

:::warning

Do not back up etcd resources until the initial encryption process is completed. If the encryption process is not completed, the backup might be only partially encrypted.

After you enable etcd encryption, several changes can occur:

- The etcd encryption might affect the memory consumption of a few resources.
- You might notice a transient effect on backup performance because the leader must serve the backup.
- A disk I/O can affect the node that receives the backup state.

:::

You can encrypt the etcd database in either AES-GCM or AES-CBC encryption.

:::note

To migrate your etcd database from one encryption type to the other, you can modify the API server’s `spec.encryption.type` field. Migration of the etcd data to the new encryption type occurs automatically.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

**Procedure**

1. Modify the `APIServer` object:
   ```terminal
   $ oc edit apiserver
   ```
2. Set the `spec.encryption.type` field to `aesgcm` or `aescbc`:
   ```yaml
   spec:
     encryption:
       type: aesgcm
   ```

   - The `aesgcm` value specifies AES-GCM encryption. Alternatively, set the `type` field to `aescbc` for AES-CBC encryption.
3. Save the file to apply the changes.
   The encryption process starts. It can take 20 minutes or longer for this process to complete, depending on the size of the etcd database.

**Verification**

- Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get openshiftapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
  ```

  The output shows `EncryptionCompleted` upon successful encryption:

  ```terminal
  EncryptionCompleted
  All resources encrypted: routes.route.openshift.io
  ```

  If the output shows `EncryptionInProgress`, encryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.
- Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
  ```

  The output shows `EncryptionCompleted` upon successful encryption:

  ```terminal
  EncryptionCompleted
  All resources encrypted: secrets, configmaps
  ```

  If the output shows `EncryptionInProgress`, encryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.
- Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift OAuth API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get authentication.operator.openshift.io -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
  ```

  The output shows `EncryptionCompleted` upon successful encryption:

  ```terminal
  EncryptionCompleted
  All resources encrypted: oauthaccesstokens.oauth.openshift.io, oauthauthorizetokens.oauth.openshift.io
  ```

  If the output shows `EncryptionInProgress`, encryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

### Disabling etcd encryption {#disabling-etcd-encryption_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Disable etcd encryption when you no longer need to encrypt sensitive cluster resources at rest.

**Prerequisites**

- Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

**Procedure**

1. Modify the `APIServer` object:
   ```terminal
   $ oc edit apiserver
   ```
2. Set the `encryption` field type to `identity`:
   ```yaml
   spec:
     encryption:
       type: identity
   ```

   The `identity` value specifies that no encryption is performed. This is the default value.
3. Save the file to apply the changes.
   The decryption process starts. It can take 20 minutes or longer for this process to complete, depending on the size of your cluster.

**Verification**

- Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get openshiftapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
  ```

  The output shows `DecryptionCompleted` upon successful decryption:

  ```terminal
  DecryptionCompleted
  Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
  ```

  If the output shows `DecryptionInProgress`, decryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.
- Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
  ```

  The output shows `DecryptionCompleted` upon successful decryption:

  ```terminal
  DecryptionCompleted
  Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
  ```

  If the output shows `DecryptionInProgress`, decryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.
- Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift OAuth API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get authentication.operator.openshift.io -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
  ```

  The output shows `DecryptionCompleted` upon successful decryption:

  ```terminal
  DecryptionCompleted
  Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
  ```

  If the output shows `DecryptionInProgress`, decryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

### Backing up etcd data {#backing-up-etcd-data_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can back up etcd data by creating an etcd snapshot and saving the static pod resources on a control plane host. This backup preserves the cluster state and provides the resources required to restore etcd at a later time.

:::warning

Only save a backup from a single control plane host. Do not take a backup from each control plane host in the cluster.

:::

For a Two-Node with Fencing (TNF) setup, follow the steps to back up etcd data on only one node in the cluster. The cluster restore process is driven by data from a single node, so you can perform the etcd backup steps on only one node.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
- You have verified whether the cluster-wide proxy is enabled.
  :::tip

  You can check whether the proxy is enabled by reviewing the output of `oc get proxy cluster -o yaml`. The proxy is enabled if the `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, and `noProxy` fields have values set.

  :::

**Procedure**

1. Start a debug session as root for a control plane node:
   ```terminal
   $ oc debug --as-root node/<node_name>
   ```
2. Change your root directory to `/host` in the debug shell:
   ```terminal
   sh-4.4# chroot /host
   ```
3. If the cluster-wide proxy is enabled, export the `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables by running the following commands:
   ```terminal
   $ export HTTP_PROXY=http://<your_proxy.example.com>:8080
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ export HTTPS_PROXY=https://<your_proxy.example.com>:8080
   ```

   ```terminal
   $ export NO_PROXY=<example.com>
   ```
4. Run the `cluster-backup.sh` script with the path to the directory where you want to save the backup:
   :::tip

   The `cluster-backup.sh` script is maintained as a component of the etcd Cluster Operator and is a wrapper around the `etcdctl snapshot save` command.

   :::

   ```terminal
   sh-4.4# /usr/local/bin/cluster-backup.sh /home/core/assets/backup

   snapshot db and kube resources are successfully saved to /home/core/assets/backup
   ```

   In this example, two files are created in the `/home/core/assets/backup/` directory on the control plane host:

   - `snapshot_<datetimestamp>.db`: This file is the etcd snapshot. The `cluster-backup.sh` script confirms the validity of the snapshot.
   - `static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz`: This file contains the resources for the static pods. If etcd encryption is enabled, it also contains the encryption keys for the etcd snapshot.
     :::note

     If etcd encryption is enabled, store this second file separately from the etcd snapshot for security reasons. However, this file is required to restore from the etcd snapshot.

     The etcd encryption only encrypts values, not keys. This means that resource types, namespaces, and object names are not encrypted.

     :::

### Data defragmentation for etcd {#etcd-defrag_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To prevent etcd performance degradation and cluster-wide maintenance alarms on large clusters, monitor etcd database metrics and defragment the data store when the keyspace grows too large.

For large and dense clusters, etcd can suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows too large and exceeds the space quota. Periodically maintain and defragment etcd to free up space in the data store. Monitor Prometheus for etcd metrics and defragment it when required. Otherwise, etcd can raise a cluster-wide alarm that puts the cluster into a maintenance mode, which accepts only key reads and deletes.

Monitor these key metrics:

- `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes`, which is the current quota limit
- `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes`, which indicates the actual database usage after a history compaction
- `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes`, which shows the database size, including free space waiting for defragmentation

Defragment etcd data to reclaim disk space after events that cause disk fragmentation, such as etcd history compaction.

History compaction is performed automatically every five minutes and leaves gaps in the back-end database. This fragmented space is available for use by etcd, but is not available to the host file system. You must defragment etcd to make this space available to the host file system.

Defragmentation occurs automatically, but you can also trigger it manually.

### Automatic defragmentation {#automatic-defrag-etcd-data_post-install-cluster-tasks}

When etcd database growth affects performance, the etcd Operator can automatically defragment member disks based on cluster metrics.

:::note

Automatic defragmentation works well in most cases because the etcd Operator uses cluster metrics to choose the most efficient defragmentation approach.

:::

The etcd Operator automatically defragments disks. No manual intervention is needed.

Verify that defragmentation succeeded by checking one of these logs:

- etcd logs
- cluster-etcd-operator pod
- operator status error log

:::warning

Automatic defragmentation can cause leader election failure in various OpenShift Container Platform core components, such as the Kubernetes controller manager, which triggers a restart of the failing component. The restart is harmless and either triggers failover to the next running instance or the component resumes work again after the restart.

:::

The following is example log output for successful defragmentation:

```terminal
etcd member has been defragmented: __<member_name>__, memberID: __<member_id>__
```

The following is example log output for unsuccessful defragmentation:

```terminal
failed defrag on member: __<member_name>__, memberID: __<member_id>__: __<error_message>__
```

### Manually defragmenting etcd data {#manual-defrag-etcd-data_post-install-cluster-tasks}

When automatic etcd defragmentation cannot reclaim enough space, manually defragment etcd on each member to restore disk availability and normal cluster operation.

A Prometheus alert indicates when you need to use manual defragmentation. The alert is displayed in two cases:

- When etcd uses more than 50% of its available space for more than 10 minutes
- When etcd is actively using less than 50% of its total database size for more than 10 minutes

You can also determine whether defragmentation is needed by checking the etcd database size in MB that will be freed by defragmentation with the PromQL expression: `(etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes - etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes)/1024/1024`

:::warning

Defragmenting etcd is a blocking action. The etcd member does not respond until defragmentation is complete. For this reason, wait at least one minute between defragmentation actions on each of the pods to allow the cluster to recover.

:::

Follow this procedure to defragment etcd data on each etcd member.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

**Procedure**

1. Determine which etcd member is the leader, because the leader should be defragmented last.
   1. Get the list of etcd pods:
      ```terminal
      $ oc -n openshift-etcd get pods -l k8s-app=etcd -o wide
      ```

      The following is example output:

      ```terminal

      etcd-ip-10-0-191-37.example.redhat.com                 3/3     Running     0          173m   10.0.191.37    ip-10-0-191-37.example.redhat.com    <none>           <none>
      etcd-ip-10-0-199-170.example.redhat.com                3/3     Running     0          176m   10.0.199.170   ip-10-0-199-170.example.redhat.com   <none>           <none>
      ```
   2. Choose a pod and run the following command to determine which etcd member is the leader:
      ```terminal
      $ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-ip-10-0-159-225.example.redhat.com etcdctl endpoint status --cluster -w table
      ```

      The following is example output:

      ```terminal
      Defaulting container name to etcdctl.
      Use 'oc describe pod/etcd-ip-10-0-159-225.example.redhat.com -n openshift-etcd' to see all of the containers in this pod.
      +---------------------------+------------------+---------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+------------+--------------------+--------+
      |         ENDPOINT          |        ID        | VERSION | DB SIZE | IS LEADER | IS LEARNER | RAFT TERM | RAFT INDEX | RAFT APPLIED INDEX | ERRORS |
      +---------------------------+------------------+---------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+------------+--------------------+--------+
      |  https://10.0.191.37:2379 | 251cd44483d811c3 |   3.5.9 |  104 MB |     false |      false |         7 |      91624 |              91624 |        |
      | https://10.0.159.225:2379 | 264c7c58ecbdabee |   3.5.9 |  104 MB |     false |      false |         7 |      91624 |              91624 |        |
      | https://10.0.199.170:2379 | 9ac311f93915cc79 |   3.5.9 |  104 MB |      true |      false |         7 |      91624 |              91624 |        |
      +---------------------------+------------------+---------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+------------+--------------------+--------+
      ```

      Based on the `IS LEADER` column of this output, the `https://10.0.199.170:2379` endpoint is the leader. Matching this endpoint with the output of the previous step, the pod name of the leader is `etcd-ip-10-0-199-170.example.redhat.com`.
2. Defragment an etcd member.
   1. Connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that is *not* the leader:
      ```terminal
      $ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-ip-10-0-159-225.example.redhat.com
      ```
   2. Unset the `ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS` environment variable:
      ```terminal
      sh-4.4# unset ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS
      ```
   3. Defragment the etcd member:
      ```terminal
      sh-4.4# etcdctl --command-timeout=30s --endpoints=https://localhost:2379 defrag
      ```

      The following is example output:

      ```terminal
      Finished defragmenting etcd member[https://localhost:2379]
      ```

      If a timeout error occurs, increase the value for `--command-timeout` until the command succeeds.
   4. Verify that the database size was reduced:
      ```terminal
      sh-4.4# etcdctl endpoint status -w table --cluster
      ```

      The following is example output:

      ```terminal
      +---------------------------+------------------+---------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+------------+--------------------+--------+
      |         ENDPOINT          |        ID        | VERSION | DB SIZE | IS LEADER | IS LEARNER | RAFT TERM | RAFT INDEX | RAFT APPLIED INDEX | ERRORS |
      +---------------------------+------------------+---------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+------------+--------------------+--------+
      |  https://10.0.191.37:2379 | 251cd44483d811c3 |   3.5.9 |  104 MB |     false |      false |         7 |      91624 |              91624 |        |
      | https://10.0.159.225:2379 | 264c7c58ecbdabee |   3.5.9 |   41 MB |     false |      false |         7 |      91624 |              91624 |        | (1)
      | https://10.0.199.170:2379 | 9ac311f93915cc79 |   3.5.9 |  104 MB |      true |      false |         7 |      91624 |              91624 |        |
      +---------------------------+------------------+---------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+------------+--------------------+--------+
      ```

      This example shows that the database size for this etcd member is now 41 MB as opposed to the starting size of 104 MB.
   5. Repeat these steps to connect to each of the other etcd members and defragment them. Always defragment the leader last.
      Wait at least one minute between defragmentation actions to allow the etcd pod to recover. Until the etcd pod recovers, the etcd member does not respond.
3. If any `NOSPACE` alarms were triggered due to the space quota being exceeded, clear them.
   1. Check if there are any `NOSPACE` alarms:
      ```terminal
      sh-4.4# etcdctl alarm list
      ```

      The following is example output:

      ```terminal
      memberID:12345678912345678912 alarm:NOSPACE
      ```
   2. Clear the alarms:
      ```terminal
      sh-4.4# etcdctl alarm disarm
      ```

### Restoring to an earlier cluster state for more than one node {#dr-scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To restore your OpenShift Container Platform cluster with more than one control plane node to an earlier state, use a saved etcd snapshot after quorum loss or critical data deletion.

For a Two-Node with Fencing (TNF) setup, a single surviving node can continue to operate in degraded mode. Use a saved etcd backup to restore an earlier cluster state if only one node is operational, or when both nodes have failed and you need to restart the cluster from a known safe state. In both cases, perform the restore procedure on a single node. The peer node automatically synchronizes data with the restored node when it rejoins the cluster.

Before you restore from backup on the recovery host, shut down etcd on enough control plane nodes so the remaining members cannot form a quorum:

- Shut down etcd on 2 hosts in a 3-node cluster.
- Shut down etcd on 3 hosts in a 4-node or 5-node cluster.

If too few hosts are shut down, the other etcd members might still form a quorum and continue service while you restore.

:::note

If your cluster uses a control plane machine set, see "Recovering a degraded etcd Operator" in the control plane machine set troubleshooting topic for an etcd recovery procedure. For OpenShift Container Platform on a single node, follow the procedure to restore to an earlier cluster state for a single node.

:::

:::warning

When you restore your cluster, you must use an etcd backup that was taken from the same z-stream release. For example, an OpenShift Container Platform 4.22.2 cluster must use an etcd backup that was taken from 4.22.2.

:::

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role through a certificate-based `kubeconfig` file, like the one that was used during installation.
- You have a healthy control plane host to use as the recovery host.
- You have SSH access to control plane hosts.
- You have a backup directory containing both the `etcd` snapshot and the resources for the static pods, which were from the same backup. The file names in the directory must be in the following formats: `snapshot_<datetimestamp>.db` and `static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz`.
- Control plane nodes are accessible or bootable.

:::warning

For non-recovery control plane nodes, it is not required to establish SSH connectivity or to stop the static pods. You can delete and re-create other non-recovery, control plane machines, one by one.

:::

**Procedure**

1. Select a control plane host to use as the recovery host. This is the host that you run the restore operation on.
2. Establish SSH connectivity to each of the control plane nodes, including the recovery host.
   `kube-apiserver` becomes inaccessible after the restore process starts, so you cannot access the control plane nodes. Establish SSH connectivity to each control plane host in a separate terminal.

   :::warning

   If you do not complete this step, you cannot access the control plane hosts to complete the restore procedure, and you cannot recover your cluster from this state.

   :::
3. Using SSH, connect to each control plane node to disable etcd by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ sudo -E /usr/local/bin/disable-etcd.sh
   ```
4. Copy the etcd backup directory to the recovery control plane host.
   This procedure assumes that you copied the `backup` directory containing the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static pods to the `/home/core/` directory of your recovery control plane host.
5. Use SSH to connect to the recovery host. Restore the cluster from an earlier backup by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ sudo -E /usr/local/bin/cluster-restore.sh /home/core/<etcd-backup-directory>
   ```
6. Exit the SSH session.
7. When the API responds, turn off the etcd Operator quorum guard by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": {"useUnsupportedUnsafeNonHANonProductionUnstableEtcd": true}}}'
   ```

   :::warning

   For a TNF setup, do not:

   - Change the etcd Operator quorum setting.
   - Turn the etcd Operator quorum off.
   - Turn the etcd Operator quorum back on.

   :::
8. Monitor the recovery progress of the control plane by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc adm wait-for-stable-cluster
   ```

   :::note

   It can take up to 15 minutes for the control plane to recover. Wait for the control plane to recover before using the next step.

   :::
9. Enable the quorum guard by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": null}}'
   ```

**Troubleshooting**

If the etcd static pods do not roll out, you can manually force an etcd redeployment from the `cluster-etcd-operator` by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch etcd cluster -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "recovery-'"$(date --rfc-3339=ns )"'"}}' --type=merge
```

### Issues and workarounds for restoring a persistent storage state {#dr-scenario-cluster-state-issues_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To restore workloads safely after an etcd snapshot restore, identify and resolve outdated persistent storage references, including volumes, credentials, attachments, and devices on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

If your OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses persistent storage of any form, a state of the cluster is typically stored outside etcd. When you restore from an etcd backup, the status of the workloads in OpenShift Container Platform is also restored. However, if the etcd snapshot is old, the status might be invalid or outdated.

:::warning

The contents of persistent volumes (PVs) are never part of the etcd snapshot. When you restore an OpenShift Container Platform cluster from an etcd snapshot, non-critical workloads might gain access to critical data, or vice-versa.

:::

The following are some example scenarios that produce an out-of-date status:

- MySQL database is running in a pod backed up by a PV object. Restoring OpenShift Container Platform from an etcd snapshot does not bring back the volume on the storage provider, and does not produce a running MySQL pod, despite the pod repeatedly attempting to start. You must manually restore this pod by restoring the volume on the storage provider, and then editing the PV to point to the new volume.
- Pod P1 is using volume A, which is attached to node X. If the etcd snapshot is taken while another pod uses the same volume on node Y, then when the etcd restore is performed, pod P1 might not be able to start correctly due to the volume still being attached to node Y. OpenShift Container Platform is not aware of the attachment, and does not automatically detach it. When this occurs, the volume must be manually detached from node Y so that the volume can attach on node X, and then pod P1 can start.
- Cloud provider or storage provider credentials were updated after the etcd snapshot was taken. This causes any CSI drivers or Operators that depend on those credentials to not work. You might have to manually update the credentials required by those drivers or Operators.
- A device is removed or renamed from OpenShift Container Platform nodes after the etcd snapshot is taken. The Local Storage Operator creates symlinks for each PV that it manages from `/dev/disk/by-id` or `/dev` directories. This situation might cause the local PVs to refer to devices that no longer exist.
  To fix this problem, an administrator must:

  1. Manually remove the PVs with invalid devices.
  2. Remove symlinks from respective nodes.
  3. Delete `LocalVolume` or `LocalVolumeSet` objects. For more information, see "Deleting the Local Storage Operator resources".

## Pod disruption budgets {#post-install-pod-disruption-budgets_post-install-cluster-tasks}

Understand and configure pod disruption budgets to control voluntary disruptions during cluster operations.

### Understand how to use pod disruption budgets to specify the number of pods that must be up {#nodes-pods-pod-disruption-about_post-install-cluster-tasks}

To ensure pod availability during voluntary disruptions such as node maintenance or cluster updates, you can use pod disruption budgets to define safety constraints for your applications.

A `PodDisruptionBudget` is an API object that specifies the minimum number or percentage of replicas that must be up at a time. Setting these in projects can be helpful during node maintenance (such as scaling a cluster down or a cluster upgrade) and is only honored on voluntary evictions (not on node failures).

A `PodDisruptionBudget` object’s configuration consists of the following key parts:

- A label selector, which is a label query over a set of pods.
- An availability level, which specifies the minimum number of pods that must be available simultaneously, either:
  - `minAvailable` is the number of pods must always be available, even during a disruption.
  - `maxUnavailable` is the number of pods can be unavailable during a disruption.

  :::note

  `Available` refers to the number of pods that has condition `Ready=True`. `Ready=True` refers to the pod that is able to serve requests and should be added to the load balancing pools of all matching services.

  A `maxUnavailable` of `0%` or `0` or a `minAvailable` of `100%` or equal to the number of replicas is permitted but can block nodes from being drained.

  :::

  :::warning

  The default setting for `maxUnavailable` is `1` for all the machine config pools in OpenShift Container Platform. It is recommended to not change this value and update one control plane node at a time. Do not change this value to `3` for the control plane pool.

  :::

You can check for pod disruption budgets across all projects with the following:

```terminal
$ oc get poddisruptionbudget --all-namespaces
```

:::note

The following example contains some values that are specific to OpenShift Container Platform on AWS.

```

The `PodDisruptionBudget` is considered healthy when there are at least `minAvailable` pods running in the system. Every pod above that limit can be evicted.

:::note

Depending on your pod priority and preemption settings, lower-priority pods might be removed despite their pod disruption budget requirements.

:::

### Specify the number of pods that must be up with pod disruption budgets {#nodes-pods-pod-disruption-configuring_post-install-cluster-tasks}

You can use a `PodDisruptionBudget` object to specify the minimum number or percentage of replicas that must be up at a time. This ensures pod availability during voluntary disruptions such as node maintenance or cluster updates.

The following procedure shows how to configure a pod disruption budget.

**Procedure**

1. Create a YAML file with the an object definition similar to the following:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: policy/v1
   kind: PodDisruptionBudget
   metadata:
     name: my-pdb
   spec:
     minAvailable: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         name: my-pod
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>apiVersion</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the <code>policy/v1</code> API group.</dd>
   <dt><code>spec.minAvailable</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the minimum number of pods that must be available simultaneously. This can be either an integer or a string specifying a percentage, for example, <code>20%</code>.</dd>
   <dt><code>spec.selector</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a label query over a set of resources. The result of <code>matchLabels</code> and <code>matchExpressions</code> are logically conjoined. Leave this parameter blank, for example <code>selector {}</code>, to select all pods in the project.</dd>
   </dl>

   Or:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: policy/v1
   kind: PodDisruptionBudget
   metadata:
     name: my-pdb
   spec:
     maxUnavailable: 25%
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         name: my-pod
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>apiVersion</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the <code>policy/v1</code> API group.</dd>
   <dt><code>spec.maxUnavailable</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable simultaneously. This can be either an integer or a string specifying a percentage, for example, <code>20%</code>.</dd>
   <dt><code>spec.selector</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies a label query over a set of resources. The result of <code>matchLabels</code> and <code>matchExpressions</code> are logically conjoined. Leave this parameter blank, for example <code>selector {}</code>, to select all pods in the project.</dd>
   </dl>
2. Run the following command to add the object to project:
   ```terminal
   $ oc create -f </path/to/file> -n <project_name>
   ```

### Specify the eviction policy for unhealthy pods {#pod-disruption-eviction-policy_post-install-cluster-tasks}

When you use pod disruption budgets (PDBs) to specify how many pods must be available simultaneously, you can also define the criteria for how unhealthy pods are considered for eviction. The eviction policy determines which pods the cluster can evict.

You can choose one of the following policies:

IfHealthyBudget
: Running pods that are not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted.

AlwaysAllow
: Running pods that are not yet healthy can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in the pod disruption budget is met. This policy can help evict malfunctioning applications, such as ones with pods stuck in the `CrashLoopBackOff` state or failing to report the `Ready` status.

  :::note

  It is recommended to set the `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` field to `AlwaysAllow` in the `PodDisruptionBudget` object to support the eviction of misbehaving applications during a node drain. The default behavior is to wait for the application pods to become healthy before the drain can proceed.

  :::

**Procedure**

1. Create a YAML file that defines a `PodDisruptionBudget` object and specify the unhealthy pod eviction policy:
   ```yaml title="Example pod-disruption-budget.yaml file"
   apiVersion: policy/v1
   kind: PodDisruptionBudget
   metadata:
     name: my-pdb
   spec:
     minAvailable: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         name: my-pod
     unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy: AlwaysAllow
   ```

   where:

   <dl>
   <dt><code>spec.unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy</code></dt>
   <dd>Specifies the unhealthy pod eviction policy, either <code>IfHealthyBudget</code> or <code>AlwaysAllow</code>. The default is <code>IfHealthyBudget</code> when the <code>unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy</code> field is empty.</dd>
   </dl>
2. Create the `PodDisruptionBudget` object by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc create -f pod-disruption-budget.yaml
   ```

   With a PDB that has the `AlwaysAllow` unhealthy pod eviction policy set, you can now drain nodes and evict the pods for a malfunctioning application guarded by this PDB.
