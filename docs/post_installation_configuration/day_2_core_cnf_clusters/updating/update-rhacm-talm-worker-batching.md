# Prepare worker node pools before a cluster update with TALM {#core-cluster-upgrades-worker-batching}

<a id="core-cluster-upgrades-worker-batching"></a>

You can configure worker node batching to control how many worker nodes update simultaneously and how workloads tolerate disruption during cluster updates by using `MachineConfigPool` and `PodDisruptionBudget` resources.

## Configuring worker node batching by using machine config pools {#core-cluster-upgrade-worker-batching-mcp_core-cluster-upgrades-worker-batching}

You can configure the `MachineConfigPool` resource to control how many worker nodes update simultaneously during a cluster update. Adjusting the `maxUnavailable` setting balances update speed against workload availability.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the target cluster with cluster-admin privileges.
- The `oc` CLI tool is installed and configured.

**Procedure**

1. Check the current `maxUnavailable` setting for the worker `MachineConfigPool` resource by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get mcp worker -o jsonpath='{.spec.maxUnavailable}'
   ```
2. Set the required `maxUnavailable` value in the worker `MachineConfigPool` resource by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc patch mcp worker --type merge -p '{"spec":{"maxUnavailable":"<max_unavailable>"}}'
   ```

   where `<max_unavailable>` is one of the following values:

   - An integer, for example `1`, to specify the exact number of nodes that can be unavailable during the update.
   - A percentage, for example `"50%"`, to specify the proportion of nodes that can be unavailable.

   :::note

   The default `maxUnavailable` value is 1 worker node or 33% of worker nodes, whichever is smaller. Setting a higher value accelerates updates but increases the number of nodes unavailable at any given time. Consult your application teams to find the appropriate value for your workloads.

   :::
3. Verify the updated setting by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get mcp worker -o yaml
   ```

**Verification**

- Verify the `MachineConfigPool` resource reflects the updated `maxUnavailable` value by running the following command:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get mcp worker -o jsonpath='{.spec.maxUnavailable}'
  ```

## Configuring worker node batching by using pod disruption budgets {#core-cluster-upgrade-worker-batching-pdb_core-cluster-upgrades-worker-batching}

You can configure `PodDisruptionBudget` resources to control how your workloads tolerate node draining during cluster updates. Pod disruption budgets ensure that a minimum number of pod replicas remain available during worker node updates.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the target cluster with cluster-admin privileges.
- The `oc` CLI tool is installed and configured.
- You have identified critical workloads that run with replicas.

**Procedure**

1. Create a `PodDisruptionBudget` resource for each critical workload:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: policy/v1
   kind: PodDisruptionBudget
   metadata:
     name: <pdb_name>
     namespace: <namespace>
   spec:
     maxUnavailable: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: <app_label>
   ```

   where:

   - `<pdb_name>`: Specifies a name for the `PodDisruptionBudget` resource, for example `cnf-workload-pdb`.
   - `<namespace>`: Specifies the namespace where the workload runs, for example `cnf-workload`.
   - `maxUnavailable`: Specifies the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during a disruption. Set this value to at least `1` to allow node draining to proceed.
   - `<app_label>`: Specifies the label selector that matches the pods for this workload.
2. Apply the `PodDisruptionBudget` resource by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc apply -f <pdb_filename>.yaml
   ```
3. Verify that the pod disruption budget allows at least one disruption by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get pdb <pdb_name> -n <namespace>
   ```

   The following example shows the output:

   ```terminal
   NAME               MIN AVAILABLE   MAX UNAVAILABLE   ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS   AGE
   cnf-workload-pdb   N/A             1                 1                     30s
   ```

   :::warning

   Ensure the `ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS` column shows a value greater than 0. If this value is 0, the pod disruption budget blocks node draining and updates stall. Do not set `minAvailable` to 100% of replicas, as this prevents any disruption.

   :::
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all critical workloads in your cluster.
5. Verify all pod disruption budgets across the cluster by running the following command:
   ```terminal
   $ oc get pdb -A
   ```

**Verification**

- Verify that no pod disruption budgets are blocking disruptions by running the following command:
  ```terminal
  $ oc get pdb -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.status.disruptionsAllowed==0)]}{.metadata.namespace}{"\t"}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'
  ```

  This command must produce no output. If the output lists any pod disruption budgets, adjust their configuration before updating.
